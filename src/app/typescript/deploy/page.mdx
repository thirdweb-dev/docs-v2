# Deploying contracts

## Requirements

To deploy contracts, you will first need to instantiate the SDK with a valid signer.

You can then use the `sdk.deployer` object to deploy contracts.

## Deploying prebuilt contracts

Deploy one of thirdweb's prebuilt contracts.

```ts
const txResult = await sdk.deployer.deployBuiltInContract(
	"nft-collection", // ex: nft-collection, edition-drop, etc
	{
		name: "My Contract",
		primary_sale_recipient: "{{wallet_address}}",
	},
);
```
