# Deploying contracts

To deploy contracts, you will first need to instantiate the SDK with a valid signer.

```ts
const sdk = await ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, "sepolia");
const address = await sdk.deployer.deployBuiltInContract("nft-collection", {
	name: "My NFT Contract",
	primary_sale_recipient: "0x...",
});
console.log("Deployed at", address);
```

## Deploy methods

You can then use the [`sdk.deployer`](/references/typescript/ContractDeployer) object to deploy different kind of contracts.
