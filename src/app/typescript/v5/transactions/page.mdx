# Transactions

Transactions are the primary way to interact with smart contracts.

## Reading contract state

<Details summary='readContract' startExpanded>

You can read contract state directly using the `readContract` function.

```ts
import { readContract } from "thirdweb";

const balance = await readContract({
	//  ^? const balance: bigint
	contract: contract,
	method: "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)",
	params: ["0x123..."],
});
```

</Details>

## Writing contract state

### Prepare a transaction

Transactions are created using the `prepareTransaction` function.

There are 4 ways to create a transaction, all of these return the same transaction object.

<Details summary="Method Signature" id='method-signature'>

```ts
import { prepareTransaction, parseEther } from "thirdweb";

const tx = prepareTransaction({
	contract,
	// pass the method signature that you want to call
	method: "function mintTo(address to, uint256 amount)",
	// and the params for that method
	// their types are automatically inferred based on the method signature
	params: ["0x123...", parseEther("100")],
});
```

</Details>

<Details summary="Automatic ABI Resolution" id='automatic-abi-resolution'>

```ts
import { prepareTransaction, parseEther } from "thirdweb";
const tx = prepareTransaction({
	contract,
	// in this case we only pass the name of the method we want to call
	method: "mintTo",
	// however using this method we lose type safety for our params
	params: ["0x123...", parseEther("100")],
});
```

</Details>

<Details summary="Explicit Contract ABI" id='explicit-abi'>

```ts
import { getContract, prepareTransaction, parseEther } from "thirdweb";

const contract = getContract({
  client,
	chainId,
  // the abi for the contract is defined here
  abi: [
    ...
    {
      name: "mintTo",
      inputs: [
        {
          type: "address",
          name: "to",
        },
        {
          type: "uint256",
          name: "amount",
        },
      ],
      type: "function",
    }
    ...
  ],
});

const tx = prepareTransaction({
  contract,
  // we get auto-completion for all the available functions on the contract ABI
  method: "mintTo",
  // including full type-safety for the params
  params: ["0x123...", parseEther("100")],
});
```

</Details>

<Details summary="ABI snippet" id='abi-snippet'>

```ts
import { prepareTransaction, parseEther } from "thirdweb";

const tx = prepareTransaction({
	contract,
	// Pass a snippet of the ABI for the method you want to call.
	method: {
		name: "mintTo",
		inputs: [
			{
				type: "address",
				name: "to",
			},
			{
				type: "uint256",
				name: "amount",
			},
		],
		type: "function",
	},
	// The Types of `params` are automatically inferred based on the ABI inputs.
	params: ["0x123...", parseEther("100")],
});
```

</Details>

### Acting on a prepared transaction

Transactions have a variety of actions that can be called on them, in all cases this is done by calling the action on the transaction object itself.

<Details summary='estimateGas'>

Estimating gas cost for a transaction

```ts
import { estimateGas } from "thirdweb";

const gasEstimate = await estimateGas({ transaction });
```

</Details>

<Details summary='sendTransaction'>

Send the prepared transaction to the blockchain. Sending a transaction requires a wallet.

See [Wallets](/typescript/v5/wallets) for more information on how to create a wallet.

```ts
import { sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";
import { privateKeyWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = privateKeyWallet({ client });

const transactionResult = await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	wallet,
});
```

</Details>

<Details summary="waitForReceipt">

Wait for a transaction to be mined and get the transaction receipt.

```ts
import { waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb";

const wallet = privateKeyWallet({ client });

const transactionResult = await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	wallet,
});

const receipt = await waitForReceipt(transactionResult);
```

</Details>

<Details summary='readContract'>

Reading contract state using a transaction.

```ts
import { prepareTransaction, readTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const tx = prepareTransaction({
	contract,
	method: "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)",
	params: ["0x123..."],
});

const balance = await readTransaction(tx);
//    ^? const balance: bigint
```
