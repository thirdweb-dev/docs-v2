# Why TypeScript SDK?

### Motivation

Developing applications on a blockchain requires reliable and performant tooling without compromising ease-of-use. Since the creation of thirdweb, we have iterated on our tools with the guidance of our users to create an SDK that outperforms other web3 libraries in performance, size, usability, and features. 

### Features

- First-party support for **embedded wallets** (email/social login) and **account abstraction**
- Connectors for **any web3 wallet**
- React **UI components** for connection, transactions, NFT rendering and more
- **Instant RPC connection** to over 1,000+ EVM chains via thirdweb RPC edge
- **Integrated IPFS** download / upload
- **Extension functions** for common contract standards
- Automatic **ABI resolution**
- **CLI** for contract deployment, publishing, and code generation

### Design

- **Single package:** Connect SDK is designed as a single package to make it easy to install, discover, and use. It includes all functionality such as smart wallets, any-evm, react, react-native, and more in the same installation.
    
    Using tree shaking patterns, the SDK is as minimal as possible to avoid unnecessary increases to the final bundle size and reduce the client-side startup time. 
    
- **Vertical integration:** Connect SDK takes advantage of concepts such as Dynamic ABIs, Extensions, Annotated Solidity, and Multi-tiered RPC caching to provide a smoother developer experience.
- **Performance optimized:** With reduced bundle size, custom network stacks, and minimal dependencies on 3rd party libraries we have prioritized the performance of the SDK to support the creation of production-grade browser applications.
- **API Design:** APIs are designed to be intuitive and simple allowing developers to easily learn and apply the patterns.
    Each function is composable allowing developers to build up complex functionality and allow improved testability. Each function is pure and side-effect free enabling better testing and composability.
