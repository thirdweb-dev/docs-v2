# Contract

A "contract" is a wrapper around a smart contract that is deployed on a chain. It is what you use to create transactions and read contract state.

```ts
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { ethereum } from "thirdweb/chains";

// get a contract
const contract = getContract({
  // the client you have created via `createClient()`
  client,
  // the contract's address
  address: "0x123...",
  // the chain the contract is deployed on
  chain: ethereum,
  // OPTIONAL: the contract's abi
  abi: [...],
});
```
