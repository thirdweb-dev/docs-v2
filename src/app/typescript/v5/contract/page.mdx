# Contract

A "contract" is a wrapper around a smart contract that is deployed on a chain. It is what you use to create transactions and read contract state

```ts
import { createClient, contract } from "thirdweb";

const client = createClient({...})
const myContract = contract({
  // pass in the client
  client,
  // pass the contract address
  address: "0x123...",
  // and the chainId
  chainId: 5,
  // OPTIONALLY the contract's abi
  abi: [...],
})
```
