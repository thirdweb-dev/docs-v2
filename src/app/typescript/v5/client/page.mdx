# Client

A client is the entry point to the thirdweb SDK. It is required for all other actions.

```ts
import { createClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createClient({
	// one of these is required to initialize a client - create a free api key at https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
	secretKey: "<you secret key>",
	// or
	clientId: "<your client id>",
});
```
