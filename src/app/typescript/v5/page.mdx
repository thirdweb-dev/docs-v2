# TypeScript SDK (Beta)

<Callout title='Beta Release' variant='warning'>

You are currently viewing the documentation for the `Beta` version of the new thirdweb TypeScript SDK.

Refer to [stable version documentation](/typescript-sdks/) for production usage.

</Callout>

TypeScript SDK is a type-safe library that interacts with any EVM-compatible blockchain with a browser or Node.js

With TypeScript SDK, you can connect to user's wallets, interact with smart contracts, sign transactions or messages, and utilize common contract standards such as ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, and marketplaces, all with built-in support for RPC URLs, IPFS gateways, and more.

### Features

- **React & React-Native Support:** 100+ React & React Native hooks with UI components to use in your application.
- **Extension-Driven Framework:** Connect SDK uses an extension-driven approach, automatically detecting and enabling functionality based on common standards such as ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and more.
- **Any EVM Compatibility:** Designed to operate with any EVM-compatible network without needing to specify ABIs, RPC URLs, or IPFS gateways.
- **High-Level Abstractions:** Simplifies complex contract interactions into easy-to-use APIs.
- **Flexibility and No Vendor Lock-in:** The SDK is modular and composable enabling customizations and replacements of the default settings and tools.
- **Interoperable:** Works side-by-side with other popular libraries and frameworks such as ethers v5, ethers v6, and viem.
