# React SDK

`thirdweb/react` exports various Components and Hooks to easily connect wallets & interact with smart contracts

## Get Started

Many of the components and hooks in the React SDK use a [`client`](/typescript/v5/core/client) to interface with the core SDK and your private RPC endpoints. You'll need to create a `clientId` in the [Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key) to generate this client.
