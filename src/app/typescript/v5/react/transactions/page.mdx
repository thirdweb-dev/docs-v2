# Transactions

## Read contract state

Reading contract state in react is done via the `useReadContract` hook. The hook returns a React Query `data`, `isLoading`, and other useful state that you can use to render your component.

```ts
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useReadContract } from "thirdweb/react";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const { data, isLoading } = useReadContract({
		contract,
		method: "function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) returns (string)",
		params: [1n],
	});
};
```

## Send transactions

Sending a transaction in react is done via the `useSendTransaction` hook. The hook returns a React Query `mutate` function that you can call with a transaction object created with `prepareContractCall` or `prepareTransaction`.

Note that unlike in TypeScript core, `useSendTransaction` does not require passing the active `Account`, it will used the current active account from the React context.

```ts
import { prepareContractCall, getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const { mutate: sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();

	const onClick = async () => {
		const transaction = prepareContractCall({
			contract,
			method: "function mint(address to)",
			params: ["0x..."],
			value: 0,
		});
		sendTransaction(transaction);
	};
};
```
