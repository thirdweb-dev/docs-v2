# Extensions

## Read extensions

Any extension that reads from the blockchain can be used with `useReadContract`. The extension function itself be passed as the first argument, and the extension's parameters must be passed as the second argument.

```ts
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useReadContract } from "thirdweb/react";
import { getOwnedNFTs } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const ownedNFTs = useReadContract(getOwnedNFTs, {
		contract,
		address: "0x...",
	});
};
```

## Write extensions

For extensions that write to the blockchain, they work the same way as raw contract calls using `useSendTransaction`.

Write extensions always return a `Transaction` object that can be passed to `useSendTransaction`.

Note that unlike in TypeScript core, `useSendTransaction` does not require passing the active `Account`, it will used the current active account from the React context.

```ts
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";
import { mintTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const { mutate: sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();

	const onClick = async () => {
		const transaction = mintTo({
			contract,
			to: "0x...",
			nft: {
				name: "NFT Name",
				description: "NFT Description",
				image: "https://example.com/image.png",
			},
		});
		sendTransaction(transaction);
	};
};
```
