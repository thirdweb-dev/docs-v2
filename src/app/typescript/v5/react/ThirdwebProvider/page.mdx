# ThirdwebProvider

`ThirdwebProvider` is a light-weight component that sets up React Query context for thirdweb SDK hooks.

<Callout title="Server-side rendering" variant="info">

    ThirdwebProvider uses context and does not currently support server-side rendering.

    If you're using a framework like Next.js, you'll need to opt-out of SSR with "use client" or whatever your framework of choice supports.

</Callout>

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

function AppWithProvider() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<App />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```
