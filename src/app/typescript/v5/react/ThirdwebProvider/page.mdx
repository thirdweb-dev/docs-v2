# ThirdwebProvider

`ThirdwebProvider` is a light-weight component that sets up React Query context for thirdweb SDK hooks. It takes no props. All wallet and auth management is handled on the wallets themselves.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

function AppWithProvider() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<App />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```
