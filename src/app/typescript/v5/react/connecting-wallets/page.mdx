# Connecting Wallets

## Using Components

You can use [`ConnectButton`](/typescript/v5/react/components/ConnectButton) or [`ConnectEmbed`](/typescript/v5/react/components/ConnectButton) component for a quick, easy and customizable UI.

These components provide a beautiful UI for connecting various wallets and takes care of a lot of wallet specific edge cases - so you can focus on building your app.

## Creating a custom UI

You can build a completely custom UI for connecting the wallet using the [`useConnect`](/references/typescript/v5/useConnect) hook to connect any of [support wallets](/typescript/v5/wallets)
