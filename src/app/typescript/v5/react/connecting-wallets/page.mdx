# Connecting Wallets

The SDK supports 350+ wallets out of the box, all you need to pass is their id.

<Stack>

<ArticleIconCard

	icon={ComponentIcon}

## Using Components

You can use [`ConnectButton`](/typescript/v5/react/components/ConnectButton) or [`ConnectEmbed`](/typescript/v5/react/components/ConnectButton) component for a quick, easy and customizable UI.

These components provide a beautiful UI for connecting various wallets and take care of a lot of wallet-specific edge cases - so you can focus on building your app.

These components support over 300+ wallets, including support in-app wallets and account abstraction.

It also automatically shows all installed `EIP-6963` compliant wallet extensions installed by the user.

## Using Hooks

You can build a completely custom UI for connecting the wallet using the [`useConnect`](/references/typescript/v5/useConnect) hook to connect any of [support wallets](/typescript/v5/wallets).

Refer to [`createWallet`](/references/typescript/v5/createWallet) and [`injectedProvider`](/references/typescript/v5/injectedProvider) for more information.

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";
import { createWallet, injectedProvider } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });

function Example() {
	const { connect, isConnecting, error } = useConnect();
	return (
		<button
			onClick={() =>
				connect(async () => {
					const metamask = createWallet("io.metamask"); // pass the wallet id

					// if user has metamask installed, connect to it
					if (injectedProvider("io.metamask")) {
						await metamask.connect({ client });
					}

					// open wallet connect modal so user can scan the QR code and connect
					else {
						await metamask.connect({
							client,
							walletConnect: { showQrModal: true },
						});
					}

					// return the wallet
					return wallet;
				})
			}
		>
			Connect
		</button>
	);
}
```

## Post Connection

Once the wallet is connected, you can use the [Wallet Connection hooks](/references/typescript/v5/hooks#wallet-connection) to get information about the connected wallet like getting the address, account, etc
