# Connecting Wallets

## Using Components

You can use [`ConnectButton`](/typescript/v5/react/components/ConnectButton) or [`ConnectEmbed`](/typescript/v5/react/components/ConnectButton) component for a quick, easy and customizable UI.

These components provide a beautiful UI for connecting various wallets and take care of a lot of wallet-specific edge cases - so you can focus on building your app.

These components support over 300+ wallets, including support embedded wallets and account abstraction.

It also automatically any `EIP-6963` compliant wallets installed by the user.

## Using Hooks

You can build a completely custom UI for connecting the wallet using the [`useConnect`](/references/typescript/v5/useConnect) hook to connect any of [support wallets](/typescript/v5/wallets)

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";
import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });

function Example() {
	const { connect, isConnecting, error } = useConnect();
	return (
		<button
			onClick={() =>
				connect(async () => {
					// instantiate wallet
					const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask");
					// connect wallet
					await wallet.connect({
						client,
					});
					// return the wallet
					return wallet;
				})
			}
		>
			Connect
		</button>
	);
}
```

## Post Connection

Once the wallet is connected, you can use the [Wallet Connection hooks](/references/typescript/v5/hooks#wallet-connection) to get information about the connected wallet like getting the address, account, etc
