# Extensions

_**Alpha Note**: Currently some extensions are available for ERC20 and ERC721 standards, we are constantly adding more._

Extensions are "pre-compiled" [transactions](#transactions) for common actions. Their API is generally same as for transactions / reading contract state.

They are namespaced by ERC standard, meaning you can import them like this:

```ts
// import the `balanceOf` and `mintTo` extensions for the ERC20 standard
import { balanceOf, mintTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";
```

## Usage in Backend (Node, Bun, Deno, etc)

### With Extensions

```ts
import { createClient, contract } from "thirdweb";
import { privateKeyWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/private-key";
import { balanceOf, mintTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";
import { sendTransaction, waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb/transaction";

// Step 1: create a client
const client = createClient({
	// create a secret key at https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
	secretKey: process.env.SECRET_KEY as string,
});

// Step 2: define a contract to interact with
const myContract = contract({
	client,
	// the contract address
	address: "0xBCfaB342b73E08858Ce927b1a3e3903Ddd203980",
	// the chainId of the chain the contract is deployed on
	chainId: 5,
});

// Step 3: read contract state
const balance = await balanceOf({
	contract: myContract,
	address: "0x0890C23024089675D072E984f28A93bb391a35Ab",
});

console.log("beginning balance", balance);

// Step 4: initialize a wallet
const wallet = privateKeyWallet({ client });

await wallet.connect({ pkey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string });

// Step 5: create a transaction
const tx = mintTo({
	contract: myContract,
	to: "0x0890C23024089675D072E984f28A93bb391a35Ab",
	amount: 100,
});

// Step 6: execute the transaction with the wallet
const transactionHash = await sendTransaction(tx, wallet);

console.log("tx hash", transactionHash);

// Step 7: wait for the receipt to be mined
const txReceipt = await waitForReceipt({
	transactionHash,
	contract: myContract,
});

console.log(txReceipt);

// Step 8: read contract state
const newBalance = await balanceOf({
	contract: myContract,
	address: "0x0890C23024089675D072E984f28A93bb391a35Ab",
});

console.log("ending balance", newBalance);
```

### Without Extensions

```ts
import { contract, createClient } from "thirdweb";
import {
	read,
	sendTransaction,
	transaction,
	waitForReceipt,
} from "thirdweb/transaction";
import { privateKeyWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/private-key";

// Step 1: create a client
const client = createClient({
	// create a secret key at https://thirdweb.com/dashboard
	secretKey: process.env.SECRET_KEY as string,
});

// Step 2: define a contract to interact with
const myContract = contract({
	client,
	// the contract address
	address: "0xBCfaB342b73E08858Ce927b1a3e3903Ddd203980",
	// the chainId of the chain the contract is deployed on
	chainId: 5,
});

// Step 3: read contract state
const balance = await read({
	contract: myContract,
	method: "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)",
	params: ["0x0890C23024089675D072E984f28A93bb391a35Ab"],
});

console.log("beginning balance", balance);

// Step 4: initialize a wallet
const wallet = privateKeyWallet({ client });

await wallet.connect({ pkey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string });

// Step 5: create a transaction
const tx = transaction({
	contract: myContract,
	method: "function mintTo(address to, uint256 amount)",
	params: ["0x0890C23024089675D072E984f28A93bb391a35Ab", 100n * 10n ** 18n],
});

// Step 6: execute the transaction with the wallet
const transactionHash = await sendTransaction(tx, wallet);

console.log("tx hash", transactionHash);

// Step 7: wait for the receipt to be mined
const txReceipt = await waitForReceipt({
	contract: myContract,
	transactionHash,
});

console.log(txReceipt);

// Step 8: read contract state
const newBalance = await read({
	contract: myContract,
	method: "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)",
	params: ["0x0890C23024089675D072E984f28A93bb391a35Ab"],
});

console.log("ending balance", newBalance);
```
