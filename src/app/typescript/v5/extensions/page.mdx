# Extensions

Extensions let interact with common standards (such as ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, etc.) in a more convenient way. You can use the built-in extensions or create your own.

## Built-in extensions

| Standard | Import Path                   | Description                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ERC20    | `thirdweb/extensions/erc20`   | ERC20 token standard extensions   |
| ERC721   | `thirdweb/extensions/erc721`  | ERC721 token standard extensions  |
| ERC1155  | `thirdweb/extensions/erc1155` | ERC1155 token standard extensions |

## Using extensions

To use an extension, you just need to import it and call it with the necessary parameters.

### Example: `balanceOf()` extension for ERC20 tokens

```typescript
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { balanceOf } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";

// get the contract
const contract = getContract({...});

// call the extension function
const balance = await balanceOf({
	contract,
	address: "0x5678...",
});
```

### Example: `transfer()` extension for ERC20 tokens

```typescript
import { getContract, sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";
import { transfer } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";

// get the contract
const contract = getContract({...});

// call the extension function to prepare the transaction
const transaction = transfer({
  contract,
  to: "0x1234...",
  amount: "1",
});

// send the transaction
const transactionResult = await sendTransaction({
  transaction,
  wallet,
});
```

## Creating your own extensions

You can create your own extensions. They are just regular functions that pre-define the behavior of a `prepareContractCall()` or `readContract()` function.

### Example: `balanceOf()` extension for ERC20 tokens

```typescript
import { readContract, type BaseTransactionOptions } from "thirdweb";

// define your extension function
export function balanceOf(
	// the base options include everything that is needed to interact with the contract, *except* the specific params for your function, in this case "address"
	options: BaseTransactionOptions<{ address: string }>,
) {
	return readContract({
		// pass the contract from the options
		contract: options.contract,
		// pre-define the function that `balanceOf()` will call on the smart contract
		method: "function balanceOf(address) returns (uint256)",
		// pass the params from the options
		params: [options.address],
	});
}
```

### Example: `transfer()` extension for ERC20 tokens

```typescript
import { prepareContractCall, type BaseTransactionOptions } from "thirdweb";

// define your extension function
export function transfer(
	// the base options include everything that is needed to interact with the contract, *except* the specific params for your function, in this case "to" and "amount"
	options: BaseTransactionOptions<{ to: string; amount: bigint }>,
) {
	return prepareContractCall({
		// pass the contract from the options
		contract: options.contract,
		// pre-define the function that `transfer()` will call on the smart contract
		method: "function transfer(address, uint256)",
		// pass the params from the options
		params: [options.to, options.amount],
	});
}
```
