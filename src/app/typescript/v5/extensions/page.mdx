# Extensions

_**Alpha Note**: Currently some extensions are available for ERC20 and ERC721 standards, we are constantly adding more._

Extensions are "pre-compiled" [transactions](#transactions) for common actions. Their API is generally same as for transactions / reading contract state.

They are namespaced by ERC standard, meaning you can import them like this:

```ts
// import the `balanceOf` and `mintTo` extensions for the ERC20 standard
import { balanceOf, mintTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";
```
