# Auth

Using [`EIP-4361`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) (Sign in with Ethererum) standard, you can authenticate users to your backend using only their wallet. This is a secure and easy way to authenticate users without requiring them to create an additional account.

## Example Repo

<OpenSourceCard
	title="Auth + Next.js"
	href="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/thirdweb-auth-next"
	description="A working example of Auth + Next.js"
/>

## Usage

```ts
import { createAuth } from 'thirdweb/auth';

const auth = createAuth({...});

// 1. generate a login payload for a client on the server side
const loginPayload = await auth.generatePayload({ address: '0x123...' });

// 2. send the login payload to the client to sign

// 3. verify the login payload and signature that the client sends back later
const verifiedPayload = await auth.verifyPayload({ payload: loginPayload, signature: '0x123...' });

// 4. generate a JWT for the client
const jwt = await auth.generateJWT({ payload: verifiedPayload });

// 5. set the JWT as a cookie or otherwise provide it to the client

// 6. authenticate the client based on the JWT on subsequent calls
 const { valid, parsedJWT } = await auth.verifyJWT({ jwt });
```
