# Migration from SDK v4

## Why you should migrate to SDK v5

#### 1. Better performance, happier clients
The new SDK is built with performance in mind and proper tree-shaking. Therefore, the minimum bundle size of your application is greatly reduced.

Below is the comparison of 2 similar applications, using `ConnectWallet` (v4) & `ConnectButton` (v5), which are identical in term of functionality.

|                     | SDK v4 | SDK v5
| ------------------- | ------ | -------
| Minimum bundle size | <span style={{color: 'red'}}>766kb</span>  | <span style={{color: 'green'}}>104kb</span>
| Dependencies        | `"@thirdweb-dev/react": "^4.9.4"`<br/>`"@thirdweb-dev/sdk": "^4.0.99"`<br/>`"ethers": "^5.7.2"`| `"thirdweb": "^5.42.0"`

_(Built with Next.js 14.2.5)_

#### 2. Flexibility with React hooks


### High-level changes

- All imports from `@thirdweb-dev/*` should be replaced with `thirdweb` SDK with sub-exports.
- The new SDK is `function` based rather than `class` based for better tree shaking and performance.
- All contract calls are now prepared using `prepareContractCall` and sent using the `sendTransaction` function.
- Transactions are submitted without waiting for receipt by default. You can call the `waitForReceipt` function to wait for the transaction to be mined.

### Progressive migration

If you're currently using the `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`, you can progressively migrate to the new `thirdweb` SDK. Both SDKs can be used side by side and are interoperable with each other.

You can easily share the same wallet between the two SDKs by using the `ethers5adapter` utility, allowing you to progressively replace calls one by one.

```ts
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import { prepareContractCall, sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";
import { ethers5Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers5";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(pkey, chain);

// convert the signer to be used with the new thirdweb SDK
const account = await ethers5Adapter.signer.fromEthers(sdk.getSigner());

// then use the new thirdweb SDK normally
const transaction = prepareContractCall({ ... });
await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	account,
});
```

In React, you can mix and match the v4 and v5 `ThirdwebProvider`, that gives you access to the hooks and functionality of both SDKs.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider} from "@thirdweb-dev/react" }
import { ThirdwebProvider as ThirdwebProviderV5 } from "thirdweb/react"

<ThirdwebProvider activeChain={...} clientId={...}>
  <ThirdwebProviderV5>
     ...
  </ThirdwebProviderV5>
</V4TWProvider>
```

From there, you can obtain the current signer using the `useSigner` hook, and convert it when needed using the `ethers5Adapter`:

```tsx
import { useSigner } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { ethers5Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers5";

const signer = useSigner();

const onClick = async () => {
    // convert the signer to used with the new SDK
	const account = await ethers5Adapter.signer.fromEthers(signer);
    // then use the new SDK normally
    const transaction = prepareContractCall({ ... });
    await sendTransaction({
	    transaction,
	    account,
    });
};
```
