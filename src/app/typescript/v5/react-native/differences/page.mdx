# Differences from React

The `thirdweb` package is designed to work with React Native, but there are some differences you should be aware of.

### Available wallets

Some wallets supported on the web are not available on React Native.

| Component | React | React Native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inAppWallet` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `smartWallet` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `privateKeyAccount` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `walletConnect` | ✅ | ⚠️ (coming soon) |
| `injectedWallet` | ✅ | ❌ |

### UI components

Some UI components might not be implemented yet on React Native. However, you can build your own UI easily with the hooks and functions provided.

| Component | React | React Native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ConnectButton` | ✅ |  ⚠️ (coming soon) |
| `ConnectEmbed` | ✅ |  ⚠️ (coming soon) |
| `TransactionButton` | ✅ |  ⚠️ (coming soon) |
