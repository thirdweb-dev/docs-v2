# Dynamic Account Factory

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/dynamic/DynamicAccountFactory.sol";
```

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) contract.

This factory smart contract is intended to be used to distribute ['DynamicAccounts`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) programmatically.

<GithubButtonLink href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/prebuilts/account/dynamic/DynamicAccountFactory.sol" />

<br />

<Callout title="Modification" variant="info">

If you modify the [`DynamicAccount`](/solidity/base-contracts/dynamic-account) contract, it is recommended that you write your own
factory contract by inheriting from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/solidity/extensions/base-account-factory) extension.

## Usage

Use the [CLI](/cli) [`create`](/cli/create) command to create a `DynamicAccountFactory` smart contract:

```bash
npx thirdweb create contract
```

[Deploy](/contracts/deploy/overview) your contract using the deploy cli command:

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

Or import the contract into your existing project and inherit from it.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/prebuilts/account/dynamic/DynamicAccountFactory.sol";

contract MyDynamicAccountFactory is DynamicAccountFactory {
	  constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint
    )
        DynamicAccountFactory(
            _entrypoint
        )
    {}
}
```

## Full Reference

<Details id="_initializeAccount" summary="_initializeAccount">

Called in `createAccount`. Initializes the account contract created in `createAccount`.

```solidity
    function _initializeAccount(
        address _account,
        address _admin,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal override {
        DynamicAccount(payable(_account)).initialize(_admin, _data);
    }
```

#### \_account

The address of the smart account smart contract to initialize.

#### \_admin

The address to be set as default admin role for the contract. Must be of type `address`.

#### \_data

If extra storage variables are required in your account contract, override this function, abi encode the variables,
pass them to this function as the `bytes` argument.

For example:

```solidity

function initializeAccount(
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override initializer {
    DynamicAccount(payable(_account)).initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```

#### \_account

The address of the smart account smart contract to initialize.

#### \_admin
