# ERC721Claimable

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/interface/IClaimableERC721.sol";
```

Allow other wallets to **claim** NFTs that you have lazy-minted.

This is not an extension which is detectable on the dashboard without also inheriting from other extensions.

It is recommended to use this extension alongside the [`LazyMint`](/solidity/extensions/lazymint) extension.

<Callout title="info" variant="info">

This extension is an interface and requires all of the functions to be implemented

## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/ERC721A.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/interface/IClaimableERC721.sol";

contract Contract is ERC721A, IClaimableERC721 {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        ERC721A(
            _name,
            _symbol
        )
    {}

    function _canLazyMint() internal view override returns (bool) {
        // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function verifyClaim(address _claimer, uint256 _quantity) public view virtual {
        // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function claim(address _receiver, uint256 _quantity) public payable virtual {
        // Your custom implementation here
    }
}
```

## Base Contracts Implementing This Extension

This extension is used as part of the [ERC721ClaimCustom](/solidity/extensions/erc721claimcustom) extension.
The base contracts which have ERC721ClaimCustom detected on them will also implement ERC721Claimable.

- [ERC721LazyMint](/solidity/base-contracts/erc721lazymint)
