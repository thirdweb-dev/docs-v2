# ERC1155Revealable

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/ERC1155.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/DelayedReveal.sol";
```

Create batches of ['delayed-reveal'](/glossary/delayed-reveal) NFTs that can be revealed at a later date after they have been minted and claimed.

This is an extension which is detectable in the dashboard if the smart contract implements the
[`ERC1155`](/solidity/extensions/erc1155) and [`DelayedReveal`](/solidity/extensions/delayedreveal) extensions.

## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/ERC1155.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/LazyMint.sol";
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/DelayedReveal.sol";

contract Contract is ERC1155, LazyMint, DelayedReveal {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        ERC1155(
            _name,
            _symbol
        )
    {}

    function reveal(uint256 _index, bytes calldata _key)
        external
        override
        returns (string memory revealedURI)
    {
      // Your custom implementation here
    }

    function _canLazyMint() internal view override returns (bool) {
        // Your custom implementation here
    }
}
```
