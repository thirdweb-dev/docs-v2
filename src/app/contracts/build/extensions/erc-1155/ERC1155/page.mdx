## Usage

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/eip/ERC1155.sol";

contract Contract is ERC1155 {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol
    )
        ERC1155(
            _name,
            _symbol
        )
    {}
}
```
