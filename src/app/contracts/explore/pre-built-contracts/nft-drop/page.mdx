# Overview

NFT Drop enables users to release a collection of unique NFTs using the ERC721A standard. NFT Drop uses a “drop” mechanism intended for large collections to distribute NFTs.

<Callout title="NFT Drop vs NFT Collection" variant="info">
	NFT Drop differs from [NFT
	Collection](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/nft-collection) in that it
	allows users to lazy-mint the NFT directly to their wallet. This eliminates
	the need to mint the NFT to the creator's wallet and then transfer the asset
	to another user’s wallet.
</Callout>

The NFT Drop contract can be deployed via the [dashboard](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#deploy-nft-drop-dashboard), [CLI](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#deploy-nft-drop-cli), or [SDKs](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#deploy-nft-drop-sdk).

<Callout title="Drop Design" variant="info">
	Learn more about why Drop contracts were built, how they were designed, and
	their limitations by reading the [Drop Design
	Document](/contracts/design-docs/drop)
</Callout>

## Use Cases

- Create restricted-access NFTs which can only be claimed by a specified allowlist of wallets
- Create large collections of unique NFT profile pics with each NFT corresponding to unique metadata or traits
- Create NFTs of artwork intended for distribution

## Deploy NFT Drop (Dashboard)

Learn how to deploy and manage an NFT Drop contract using dashboard.

### Deploy and configure contract

<Steps>

<Step title="Select Contract">
	Navigate to Contracts > Explore > [NFT
	Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721)
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy">

Select `Deploy now`

<DocImage
	src={require("./assets/deploy-now.png")}
	alt="Deploy a contract view from Explore"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Set Metadata">

A modal will appear to set Contract Metadata or settings to organize and distinguish between contracts. Set the following metadata:

- **Name** - name of the contract.
- **Symbol (optional)** - shortened name or symbol to denote a specific group of tokens. Similar to a stock ticker.
- **Description (optional)** - description of contract to
- **Image (optional)** - image or icon of contract

<DocImage
	src={require("./assets/contract-metadata.png")}
	alt="Contract metadata settings"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Fund distribution">

Set fund distribution recipients for Primary Sales and Secondary Sales by passing in the corresponding wallet addresses you want to receive the funds.

- **Primary Sales** - The initial recipient will receive any funds from sales made upon initially minting the NFT.

- **Royalties / Secondary Sales** - The recipient that will receive funds from any secondary sales or re-sales of the NFT.

  <DocImage
  	src={require("./assets/funds.png")}
  	alt="Fund distribution settings"
  />

- **(Optional) Platform fees** - Recipient that will receive additional fees for all primary sales that happen on this contract. (This is useful if you are deploying this contract for a 3rd party and want to take fees for your service).

  />

</Step>

<Step title="Choose network">

Choose a Network / Chain to Deploy to. [View list of available Networks.](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist)

<DocImage
	src={require("./assets/choose-network.png")}
	alt="Choose network screen"
/>

</Step>

<Step title="Sign transaction">
	Select `Deploy` and sign the transaction prompted in the connected wallet to
	finish deploying the contract.
</Step>

</Steps>

### Upload NFTs

**Single Upload**

- Single upload is a preferred option for users uploading few NFTs at a time.

**Batch Upload**

- Batch upload is a method that allows you to upload large amounts of NFTs in one click.

### Enable Delayed Reveal

Optionally, users may choose to hide their NFT image and metadata from users before minting.

## Deploy NFT Drop (CLI)

1. In the CLI run the following Deploy command:

   ```bash
   npx thirdweb deploy -n --name nft-drop
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to fill out your contract by following the Deploy NFT Drop (Dashboard) section.
