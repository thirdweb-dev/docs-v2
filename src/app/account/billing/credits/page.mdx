# Credits

Credits let you cover the costs of using thirweb services. There are two types of credits that you can receive


#### Optimism superchain credits
These can be used to cover gas fees on superchain networks. Superchain networks are a collection of networks built on the OP stack. Superchain credits are applicable across the following chains
- OP Mainnet
- Base
- Zora
- Mode
- Fraxtal

To get superchain credits, apply to join the [superchain app accelerator](https://thirdweb.com/grant/superchain?ref=blog.thirdweb.com).


This program is meant to empower developers build great smart account powered web3 user experiences. You can use your OP credits to start using Account Abstraction to sponsor your user's gas fees for free. Learn more about how you can easily integrate Account Abstraction into your apps [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect/account-abstraction). 


#### thirdweb Credits 
These are credits that can be applied across any thirdweb service on any chain. This includes usage across Embedded wallets, RPC, and IPFS storage. 

To get thirdweb credits, apply to join the [startup program.](https://thirdweb.com/community/startup-program)

You can view how many credits you have in the dashboard's [billing page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/billing) or at the top of your thirdweb dashboard.

Both forms of credits will automatically be applied to your bill at the end of the month.
