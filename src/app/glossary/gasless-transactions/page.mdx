# Gasless Transactions

Gasless Transactions, also known as meta-transactions, are transactions that have the [gas fee](/glossary/gas)
paid for by a third party instead of the transaction sender.
Typically, this means the dApp owner covers the gas costs of their users' transactions, providing a more seamless user experience.

This works by having the user sign a message that is then sent to a relayer, which pays the gas fee and forwards the transaction to the blockchain.

Our [SDK](/contracts/interact/overview) integrates seamlessly with [Biconomy](https://biconomy.io/) and [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://www.openzeppelin.com/defender), two popular gasless transaction providers;
allowing you to cover the gas fees for your users' transactions.

- [Biconomy](https://biconomy.io/): Best if you want to cover the gas fees for one kind of transaction (e.g. minting NFTs).
- [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://www.openzeppelin.com/defender): Best if you want to cover the gas fees for all kinds of transactions.

View our step-by-step guides below to learn how to integrate gasless transactions into your dApp using the SDK.
