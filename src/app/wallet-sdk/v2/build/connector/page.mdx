# Build a Wallet interface

Building a Wallet interface is done in two steps:

1. Create a `Connector` class
2. Create a `Wallet` class and use the `Connector` class in it

## 1. Create Connector class

Extend the abstract [`Connector`](/references/wallets/v2/Connector) interface and implement the all the required methods.

```javascript
import { Connector, ConnectParams } from '@thirdweb-dev/wallets';

export class MyConnector extends Connector {
  connect(options?: ConnectParams<TConnectParams>): Promise<string> {
    // ...
  }

  disconnect(): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }

  getAddress(): Promise<string> {
    // ...
  }

  getSigner(): Promise<Signer> {
    // ...
  }

  getProvider(): Promise<providers.Provider> {
    // ...
  }

  switchChain(chainId: number): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }

  isConnected(): Promise<boolean> {
    // ...
  }

  setupListeners(): Promise<void> {
    // ...
  }

  updateChains(chains: Chain[]): void {
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Required methods

<Details summary='connect' id='connect'>

This method should trigger the connection flow of your wallet with the user's app.

The arguments needed to connect your wallet. This is specific to your wallet implementation which is why we leave it open for you to
add custom arguments here.

Returns a `string` containing the wallet address, or `undefined` if the connection failed.

</Details>

<Details summary='disconnect' id='disconnect'>

Disconnect the currently connected wallet from your app.

</Details>

<Details summary='getSigner' id='getSigner'>

Returns a `Promise<Signer>` with the ethers signer associated with your wallet.

</Details>

<Details summary='getProvider' id='getProvider'>

Returns a `Promise<providers.Provider>` with the ethers provider associated with your wallet.

</Details>

<Details summary='isConnected' id='isConnected'>

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` indicating whether the wallet is connected or not.

</Details>

<Details summary='getAddress' id='getAddress'>

Returns a `Promise<string>` with the currently connected wallet address.

</Details>

### Optional methods

You can throw an exception or leave the implementation empty if you don't want to implement these methods.

<Details summary='switchChain' id='switchChain' tags={["Optional"]}>

Switch the chain the wallet is connected to.

</Details>

<Details summary='setupListeners' id='setupListeners' tags={["Optional"]}>

This method should set all listeners needed for the wallet to work. It will be used by the `AbstractClientWallet` class to set up the listeners
when the wallet is connected.

</Details>

<Details summary='updateChains' id='updateChains' tags={["Optional"]}>

Update the array of chains the wallet can connect to.

</Details>

## 2. Create Wallet class

Now that the hard part is done, the rest is easy, we just need to wrap our connector in a `AbstractClientWallet` class.

The [`AbstractClientWallet`](/wallet/interface/abstract-client-wallet) class is the base
class that provides an interface for interacting with your connector on one side and with applications on the other.

The main method that needs to be overridden is the `getConnector` method. This method should return a `Promise`
that resolves to the [`Connector`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/wallets/src/evm/interfaces/connector.ts#L6)
class that you implemented.

```javascript
export class MyWallet extends AbstractClientWallet {
  async getConnector(): Promise<Connector> {
    return new MyConnector();
  }
}
```

You can expose any custom logic here as the public API for your wallet.

## Required Methods

<Details summary="getConnector" id="getConnector">

Returns a `Promise<Connector>` with the connector class that you implemented.

 </Details>

## Using your new wallet

At this point, you should be able to instantiate your new wallet and call `connect` on it.

```ts
const wallet = new MyWallet();
wallet.connect();
```

## Examples
