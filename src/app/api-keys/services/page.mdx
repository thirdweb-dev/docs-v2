**Smart Wallet Destination Address**
A smart wallet destination address is allowed to send transactions to or interact with. These addresses can be smart contracts, EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts), or other smart wallet addresses. This feature is useful for restricting the smart wallet to only send transactions to your own contracts.

To restrict the contracts that Smart Wallet can interact with:

1. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
