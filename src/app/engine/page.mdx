# Engine

Engine is an open-source, backend server that reads, writes, and deploys contracts at production scale.

## Why use Engine?

Engine enables your app to:

- Send multiple blockchain transactions at once.
- Resubmit stuck transactions, handling nonce values, gas settings, and RPC failure cases.
- Ensure transactions are submitted exactly once.
- Manage multiple backend wallets with low fund alerts.
- Control access by your backend servers and team members.
- Sponsor gas fees for users.
- Deploy smart accounts for users.
- Store event logs and transaction receipts for your contracts.
- Offload web3 logic to Engine.
