# Engine

Engine is a backend HTTP server that calls smart contracts using your managed backend wallets.

- <strong>Create & manage funded backend wallets</strong> to send blockchain transactions
  via authenticated APIs.
- <strong>Build scalable blockchain apps</strong> with transaction retries, wallet
  nonce management, and gas estimation.
- <strong>Offer the best UX</strong> by deploying & transacting with ERC-4337 compatible smart accounts,
  enabling sign-less flows and gasless transactions.
- <strong>Get a complete web3 infrastructure</strong> already set up with RPC, IPFS,
  and account abstraction infrastructure.

  on all <a href="https://thirdweb.com/chainlist">1000+ EVM blockchains</a> and private
  subnets.

  	published smart contract

  relayers and user operations.

  events to automate sending emails, printing shipping labels, or charging customers.

## Why use Engine?

Engine is beneficial if your app:

- Handles multiple company app wallets.
- Requires controlled access by multiple team members.
- Requires transactions to be delivered reliably during traffic bursts and network congestion.
- Sends more than one transaction per block (example: 2 Ethereum transactions within 12 seconds).
- Sponsors gas fees for your users.
- Deploys smart accounts for each user.
- Triggers other actions when wallet or contract events occur.
