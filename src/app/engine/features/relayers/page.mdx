# Relayers

Use Engine as a relayer to submit meta-transactions on behalf of your users. Relayers allow your users to send blockchain transactions and have [gas fees](/glossary/gas) paid by your backend wallets.

For example, your users can transfer or list NFTs in their wallet without having gas funds.

[Learn more about gasless transactions.](/glossary/gasless-transactions)

## Requirements

- The contract you are calling must support a standard meta-transaction format:
  - [EIP-2771 Native Meta-transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771)
  - [EIP-2612 Permit Approval](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)
  - [Polygon Native Meta-transactions](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/pos/design/transactions/meta-transactions/meta-transactions/)
- Your Engine instance has a [backend wallet](/engine/features/backend-wallets) with funds.

## Create a relayer

1. Navigate to the **Explorer** section in the [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Select **Add relayer**.
1. Provide the following details:
   - **Chain**: The chain where contracts will be called.
   - **Backend Wallet**: The backend wallet that will submit meta-transactions to the forwarder. Ensure this wallet has sufficient gas funds.
   - **Label**: A descriptive name for this relayer.
   - **Allowed Contracts**: (Optional) A list of contract addresses this relayer is allowed to submit transactions to.
   - **Allowed Forwarders**: (Optional) A list of forwarder addresses this relayer is allowed to submit transactions to.

The relayer will be assigned an ID.
The relayer URL to submit transactions to will look like this: `https://<your_engine_url>/relayer/<relayer_id>`

## Submit to a relayer from your app frontend

First, update the CORS policy on Engine to allow your webapp to call Engine.

- URL: `POST /configuration/cors`
- Header
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body (example)
  ```json
  {
  	"urlsToAdd": [
  		"http://localhost:8000",
  		"https://dev.my-app.com",
  		"https://my-app.com"
  	]
  }
  ```

<Callout variant='info' title="Security note">

Relayer endpoints can be called by frontend clients without authentication. Set **Allowed Contracts** and **Allowed Forwarders** to restrict the meta-transactions your relayer will handle.

All other Engine endpoints are authenticated by access token.

</Callout>

Next, use the [thirdweb React SDK](/react) to allow users to sign transactions with their wallet and send it to your Engine relayer.

Pass the relayer URL to the SDK provider.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider
			activeChain="polygon"
			sdkOptions={{
				gasless: {
					engine: {
						relayerUrl: <engine_relayer_url>,
					},
				},
			}}
		>
			<ConnectWallet/>
			<MintComponent />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

Enable users to connect their wallet with the [`ConnectWallet`](/react/v4/components/ConnectWallet) component.

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export function Connect() {
	return <ConnectWallet />;
}
```

Create a button that sends a blockchain transaction.

```tsx
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function MintComponent() {
	const contract = useContract("0x7A0CE8524bea337f0beE853B68fAbDE145dAC0A0");

	return (
		<Button
			onClick={() => {
				// This mint transaction will be submitted by your Engine relayer.
				await contract.erc20.mint(1);
			}}
		>
			Claim
		</Button>
	);
}
```

## Submit to a relayer from your app backend

Alternatively, submit transactions to your Engine relayer from your app backend.

1. Prompt the user to _sign_ a transaction, such as transferring an NFT or minting a token.
   - This step does not require gas in the user's wallet.
   - Ensure the signature matches the format that the forwarder expects.
1. Pass the signature from your app frontend to your app backend.
1. Call Engine from your app backend.
   - Method: `POST https://<engine_url>/relayer/{relayer_id}`
   - Body:
     - `type`: "forward", "permit", or "execute-meta-transaction"
     - `request`: The transaction request details
     - `signature`: The `request` signed by the user's wallet
     - `forwarderAddress`: A forwarder address that is trusted by the contract, if `type` = "forward"
     - See the [API reference](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://demo.web3api.thirdweb.com/json#tag/Relayer/operation/relay) for details.
