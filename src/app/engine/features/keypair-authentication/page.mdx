# Keypair Authentication

Engine supports keypair authentication allowing your app to generate short-lived access tokens.

<Callout
	title="Advanced feature"
	variant="info"
>

Keypair authentication is an advanced feature and must be explicitly enabled.

[Contact us](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us) to enable this on your Cloud-hosted Engine instance.

**Don't need short-lived access tokens?**
Utilize [Access Tokens](/engine/features/access-tokens) which are valid until deleted.

</Callout>

## Use cases

- You don't want an access token to be reused for a long duration if shared or compromised.
- You want to restrict what each access token can do (e.g. specific calls).

## Usage

#### 1. Generate a keypair

Generate a cryptographic keypair in your terminal with `openssl`.

These commands generate a private and public key with the `ES256` algorithm.

```bash
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private.key
```

```bash
openssl ec -in private.key -pubout -out public.key
```

<Details id="private-key-example" summary="Private key example">

Your private key (`private.key`) looks like:

```text
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

_Note: The exact lines may differ based on the algorithm._

</Details>

<Details id="public-key-example" summary="Public key example">

Your public key (`public.key`) looks like:

```text
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

</Details>

#### 2. Add your public key to Engine

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Select **Access Tokens**.
1. Select **Keypair Authentication**.
   - Note: If this option is unavailable, your Engine instance may not be configured to support keypairs.
1. Select **Add Public Key**.
1. Add your public key including the `-----` boundary lines.

#### 3. Sign a JWT with your private key

This step must be done for each request.

```typescript
import jsonwebtoken from "jsonwebtoken";

const payload = {
	iss: publicKey,
};
const accessToken = jsonwebtoken.sign(payload, privateKey, {
	algorithm: "ES256", // The keypair algorithm
	expiresIn: "15s", // Invalidate after 15 seconds
});
```

#### 4. Authenticate Engine requests

Provide the access token in the `Authorization` header.

```typescript
await fetch(`${engineBaseUrl}/backend-wallet/get-all`, {
	headers: {
		authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
	},
});
```

## FAQ

#### How do I enable this feature on my self-hosted Engine?

Set the environment variable `ENABLE_KEYPAIR_AUTH="true"` and restart your Engine.

#### Which cryptographic algorithms are supported?

The following algorithms can be used.

| `algorithm` | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `RS256`     | RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 hash algorithm     |
| `PS256`     | RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 hash algorithm            |
| `ES256`     | ECDSA using P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm |

Refer to the OpenSSL documentation on generating keypairs for different algorithms.

Remember to change `algorithm` in the `jsonwebtoken.sign()` call on [Step 3. Sign a JWT with your private key](/engine/features/keypair-auth#3-sign-a-jwt-with-your-private-key).
