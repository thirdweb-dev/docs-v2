# FAQ

## About Engine

### How are Engine and the thirdweb Contract SDK different?

Engine is a server that manages your backend wallets and how they interact with contracts. This difference unlocks capabilities that thirdweb and other web3 SDKs, including:

- Management of KMS backend wallets
- Fine-grained access control with access tokens
- Transaction parallelization to handle higher throughput per wallet
- Observability and retries on stuck transactions
- Webhooks on completed transactions to sync onchain and off-chain activity

Additionally, Engine is built on top of the thirdweb SDK and has the same capabilities.

### Does Engine work with all thirdweb smart contracts?

Yes. Engine has intuitive interfaces to deploy prebuilt contracts, manage smart wallets, run a marketplace, and more.

### Does Engine work with my non-thirdweb smart contract?

Yes. Engine can read and write to any EVM contract with low-level API calls, including providing raw calldata. ERC-721 and ERC-1155 APIs can also be used for [contracts imported to thirdweb](https://support.thirdweb.com/smart-contracts/rtHYyzspnPaHmmANmJQz1k/importing-non-thirdweb-contracts-into-the-dashboard/hELLjgTc8TWrMdMEQkm2Es).

## Using Engine

### How do I wait for a transaction to be mined?

Write calls to contracts do not block until they are mined. Instead they enqueue an async job and immediately return a reference to the job called `queueId`.

Here are three ways to determine when the job is mined:

- Use [webhooks](/engine/features/webhooks) to notify your backend when a transaction event occurs.
- Poll the `/transaction/status/<queue_id>` endpoint.
- Use websockets:

  ```js
  const socket = new WebSocket(
  	"wss://<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>?token=<session_token>",
  );
  socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  	const res = JSON.parse(event.data);
  	console.log("Received data:", JSON.parse(res.result));
  };
  ```

### How do I cancel a transaction?

If a transaction is has not yet been mined or failed, cancel the transaction with `POST /transaction/cancel`.

Or to cancel a transaction in the Engine dashboard, select the **Cancel transaction** button next to the status in the **Transactions** table.

### How do I customize RPC URLs?

Set the `CHAIN_OVERRIDES` environment variable to the path to a JSON file or internet-accessible URL. The default value is `./chain-overrides.json` if found. See <a href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine/blob/main/chain-overrides.example.json" target="_blank">the example format</a>.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I resolve an "invalid password" error?

As of v0.0.7, an `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` is used to encrypt sensitive data stored in DB. Prior versions used the `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` by default.

To resolve this error, set `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` to the `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` used during setup.

Afterward you may change `THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` if needed. Do _not_ change `ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` since all sensitive data is encrypted with this password.

### How do I resolve issues connecting to Postgres DB?

Here are some common troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure the Postgres DB is running in Docker:
  - In same container, ensure the `host` in the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` is set to `localhost`.
  - In different container, ensure the `host` in the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` is set to `host.docker.internal`.
- Ensure the Postgres DB connection URL and credentials are correct.
- Ensure the database name exists on the Postgres DB.
