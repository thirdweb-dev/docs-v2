</Callout>

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

```bash
docker run \
  -e ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD="<encryption_password>" \
  -e THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY="<thirdweb_secret_key>" \
  -e ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS="<admin_wallet_address>" \
  -e POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable" \
  -e ENABLE_HTTPS=true \

#### Manage Engine from the dashboard

To manage your Engine instance from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to `https://localhost:3005/json`

   - The "Your connection is not private" page will appear.
   - Select **Show advanced** and select **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)** to render the JSON file.
   - _This one-time step allows your browser to connect to your local Engine instance._

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Sign in with the `<admin_wallet_address>` wallet.
1. Select **Import**
1. Add your publicly accessible Engine URL.
   - If Engine is running locally, provide the URL `https://localhost:3005`.

### Production

See [Production Checklist](/engine/production-checklist#cloud-hosting) for best practices using Engine in a production environment.
