# ERC1155Mintable

Allows you to mint new NFTs on the contract.

By default, the NFT metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before minting.
You can override this default behavior by providing a `string` that points to valid metadata object instead of an object.

## Mint

Mint a new NFT to the **connected wallet**.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC1155.Mint(new NFTMetadataWithSupply() {
    supply = 1,
    metadata = new NFTMetadata() {
        name = "My NFT", // Name of the NFT
        image = "my-image-url", // An image URL or IPFS URI
        // Any other valid metadata properties
    }
});
```

<details>
  <summary>Configuration</summary>
  <div>

#### metadataWithSupply

Provide a `string` that points to, or an `NFTMetadataWithSupply` struct containing
`metadata` that conforms to the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure),
along with the `supply` of the NFT to mint.

If you provide a struct, the metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

The `image` property can be an IPFS URI, or a URL to an image.

## MintTo

The same as [`mint`](#mint), but allows you to specify the address of the wallet rather than using the connected wallet.

```csharp
var data = await contract.ERC1155.MintTo("{{wallet_address}}", new NFTMetadataWithSupply() {
    supply = 1,
    metadata = new NFTMetadata() {
        name = "My NFT", // Name of the NFT
        image = "my-image-url", // An image URL or IPFS URI
        // Any other valid metadata properties
    }
});
```
