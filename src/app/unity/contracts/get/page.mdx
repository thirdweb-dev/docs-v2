import { Callout } from "@/components/Document";

# Connect to a deployed smart contract to start interacting with it.

## Usage

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

<Callout variant='info' title="Using contracts without an ABI">

You must pass an ABI to the `GetContract` method as its second parameter if you want to interact with the contract from the Unity editor or other native platforms.

In WebGL builds, you do not need to pass an ABI as long as your contract is imported through the thirdweb [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

</Callout>

## Configuration

### address (required)

The address of the smart contract you want to connect to.

Must be a `string`.

### Using Contract ABI

The ABI must be a C#-escaped string without spaces or line breaks for the best experience.

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("0x...", "my-abi");
```
