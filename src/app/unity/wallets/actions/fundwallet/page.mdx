The SDK comes with a built-in <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/products/pay-sdk"> Coinbase Pay</a> integration.

</p>

Coinbase Pay allows you to implement a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp within your games for users to easily purchase crypto.

Use the `FundWallet` method to begin the following flow:

1. A popup window opens where the player can purchase some cryptocurrency directly from their Coinbase account.
2. The player returns to the game with the purchased crypto in their wallet.

```csharp
// Call the "FundWallet" function to trigger the Coinbase Pay flow.
await sdk.wallet.FundWallet(new FundWalletOptions() {
    appId = "<your-app-id-here>", // https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/pay-sdk/docs/using-sdk
    address = address, // The wallet address to fund
    chainId = 137 // The chain ID of the network to fund
});
```
