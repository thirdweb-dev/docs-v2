# Local Wallet

Loads or generates a local wallet on the user's device.
This wallet is encrypted with a password and stored in local storage.
It is meant to be used as a guest wallet, and is not recommended for long-term storage of funds.

## Usage

```csharp
using Thirdweb;

public async void ConnectWallet()
{
    // Reference to your Thirdweb SDK
    var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;

    // Configure the connection
    var connection = new WalletConnection(
      provider: WalletProvider.LocalWallet,      // The wallet provider you want to connect to (Required)
      chainId: 1,                                // The chain you want to connect to (Required)
      password: "myEpicPassword"                 // Used to encrypt your Local Wallet, defaults to device uid (Optional)
    );

    // Connect the wallet
    string address = await sdk.wallet.Connect(connection);
}
```

## Behavior

### WebGL

Prompts the user to connect their Metamask browser extension.

### Standalone

Instantiates the customizeable `WalletProvider_Metamask` UI prefab, displaying a QR code and deep link button. Scan the QR code with your Metamask mobile app to connect.

### Mobile

Instantiates the customizeable `WalletProvider_Metamask` UI prefab, displaying a QR code and deep link button. Click the deep link button to connect to your Metamask mobile app.

## Miscellaneous

You may export this wallet to a JSON file, which can be imported into other wallets such as the Metamask extension.

```csharp
// Export the wallet keystore (all platforms)
string json = await sdk.wallet.Export();

// Get wallet path (native platforms)
string path = Utils.GetAccountPath();

// Delete local wallet (native platforms)
bool deleted = Utils.DeleteLocalAccount();

// Explore Utils.cs to discover more
```

If no password is passed, it defaults to `SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier`.
