# Firebase

This guide will show you how to integrate Auth as a custom authentication provider for [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and automatically create a document in the `users` Firestore collection when a user signs up successfully.

If you want to interact with the code for the Auth + Firebase integration that we'll be building in this guide, you can checkout the following GitHub repository, or clone it with the command below:

```
npx thirdweb create app --template firebase-auth
```

/>

## Prerequisites

- [Create a Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#create-project)
- [Register your Firebase app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#register-app)
- [Create and export a service account as a JSON file](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk)

## Set Up

To begin with, let's create a new Next.js project with the SDK configured:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --app --next --ts
```

From within the created directory, we need to install `@thirdweb-dev/auth`, `firebase` and `firebase-admin`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth firebase firebase-admin
```

### Configure Firebase

We'll use environment variables to store our Firebase configuration.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the corresponding values from your Firebase project:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=<firebase-app-api-key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=<firebase-app-auth-domain>
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=<firebase-app-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET=<firebase-app-storage-bucket>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<firebase-app-messaging-sender-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID=<firebase-app-app-id>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<service-account-private-key>
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=<service-account-client-id>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=<service-account-private-key-id>
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<service-account-client-email>
```

Most of the above environment variables can be found in the settings page of your Firebase project (after adding a Web app to your project), or in the service role JSON file you created and downloaded earlier.

Create a new directory called `lib` and create two helper scripts to initialize Firebase in the browser and server:

- [lib/initFirebase.ts](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/firebase-auth/blob/main/lib/initFirebase.ts)
- [lib/initFirebaseAdmin.ts](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/firebase-auth/blob/main/lib/initFirebaseAdmin.ts)

Now we have an easy way to access Firebase Auth and Firestore in both client and server environments!

### Configure thirdweb Auth

Finally, to configure thirdweb Auth, we just need to add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN` environment variable to the `.env.local` file as follows:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=<thirdweb-auth-domain>
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN` is used to prevent phishing attacks - and is usually set to the domain of your project like `example.com`. You can read more about it in the [thirdweb Auth Documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/auth/hoa-it-works/siwe#domain).

### ThirdwebProvider

Inside the `pages/_app.tsx` file, configure the `authConfig` option:

```ts title="pages/_app.tsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      clientId="your-client-id"
      authConfig={{
        // Set this to your domain to prevent signature malleability attacks.
        domain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN,
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Sign Up / Log In Users

The process of creating users in Firebase by authenticating them with their wallet has two steps:

1. Authenticate the user with their wallet
2. Create a user in Firebase with the knowledge that they own this wallet

On the homepage (`pages/index.tsx`), we'll allow the user to connect their wallet and then sign in with Ethereum.

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { ConnectWallet, useAddress, useAuth } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { doc, serverTimestamp, setDoc, getDoc } from "firebase/firestore";
import { signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";
import initializeFirebaseClient from "../lib/initFirebase";

export default function Login() {
	const thirdwebAuth = useAuth();
	const address = useAddress();
	const { auth, db } = initializeFirebaseClient();

	return (
		<div>
			{address ? (
				<button onClick={() => signIn()}>Sign in with Wallet</button>
			) : (
				<ConnectWallet />
			)}
		</div>
	);
}
```

The `signIn` function:

1. Makes a request to the `api/auth/login` endpoint to get a custom token from Firebase
2. Signs the user in with the custom token
3. Creates a user in Firestore with the verified user's address

```tsx title="pages/index.tsx"
// Note: This function lives inside the Login component above.
async function signIn() {
	// Use the same address as the one specified in _app.tsx.
	const payload = await thirdwebAuth?.login();

	try {
		// Make a request to the API with the payload.
		const res = await fetch("/api/auth/login", {
			method: "POST",
			headers: {
				"Content-Type": "application/json",
			},
			body: JSON.stringify({ payload }),
		});

		// Get the returned JWT token to use it to sign in with
		const { token } = await res.json();

		// Sign in with the token.
		const userCredential = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token);
		// On success, we have access to the user object.
		const user = userCredential.user;

		// If this is a new user, we create a new document in the database.
		const usersRef = doc(db, "users", user.uid!);
		const userDoc = await getDoc(usersRef);

		if (!userDoc.exists()) {
			// User now has permission to update their own document outlined in the Firestore rules.
			setDoc(usersRef, { createdAt: serverTimestamp() }, { merge: true });
		}
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
}
```

In this function, you'll notice we're calling the `/api/auth/login` endpoint to get a
[custom JWT token from Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens#create_custom_tokens_using_the_firebase_admin_sdk).

Let's take a look at that API route.

### Auth API Route

Create a folder that lives in the `/pages/api/auth` directory called `login.ts`.

This API route is responsible for:

1. Verifying the payload provided by the client
2. Once the payload is verified, creating a [custom token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens#create_custom_tokens_using_the_firebase_admin_sdk)
   for the user to sign in to Firebase with.

```ts title="pages/api/auth/login.ts"
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { verifyLogin } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm";
import initializeFirebaseServer from "../../../lib/initFirebaseAdmin";

export default async function login(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
	// Grab the login payload the user sent us with their request.
	const payload = req.body.payload;

	const { address, error } = await verifyLogin(
		process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN as string,
		payload,
	);
	if (!address) {
		return res.status(401).json({ error });
	}

	// Initialize the Firebase Admin SDK.
	const { auth } = initializeFirebaseServer();

	// Generate a JWT token for the user to be used on the client-side.
	const token = await auth.createCustomToken(address);

	// Send the token to the client-side.
	return res.status(200).json({ token });
}
```

You'll now be able to use Firebase Authentication to authenticate users with their wallets!

### Firestore Rules (Optional)

You'll likely want to add a [security rule](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started)
to your Firestore database that only allows users to update their documents.

```yaml title="firestore.rules"
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // The wildcard expression {userId} makes the userId variable available in rules.
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Only allow users to update their own documents.
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      // But anybody can read their profile.
      allow read;
    }
  }
}
```

### Viewing the Result

When you click the "Sign in with Ethereum" button and successfully sign in, you'll be signed up as a user in Firebase:

<Image
	className="mb-4"
	src={require("../../assets/firebase-users.png")}
	alt="firebase users"
/>

And a new document will be created in your `users` collection in Firestore:

<Image
	className="mb-4"
	src={require("../../assets/firebase-db.png")}
	alt="firebase db"
/>

You can now use all the functionality of Firebase Authentication and Firestore to build your app!
