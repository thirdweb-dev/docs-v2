# Export private key

Allow your users to export the private key for their embedded wallet embedding this page in an iframe:

```html
<iframe
	src="https://embedded-wallet.thirdweb.com/sdk/2022-08-12/embedded-wallet/export?clientId=CLIENT_ID"
/>
```

The user will be presented with a form to sign in to reveal their private key:

<Image src={ExportKey} />

## Use cases

- As your users gain familiarity with the blockchain, they may want to manage their wallet in another app.
- Your users may lose access to their email (e.g. corporate account) and want to fully own their wallet.

The export private key embed is only embeddable on sites whitelisted by your client ID in the allowed domains section. Visit the [Settings tab](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings) on the Dashboard to configure your Client ID.
