# Smart Wallet

Everything you need to build [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) Smart Wallets for your users.

## Features

thirdweb's smart wallets have the following features by default:

- The ability to have multiple owners on the same wallet.
- Give access to scoped session keys with restrictions.
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens to and from the smart wallet.
- Send and receive [ERC-721](/solidity/extensions/erc721) and [ERC-1155](/solidity/extensions/erc1155) NFTs from the smart wallet.
- Store contract metadata.
- Pay for its own gas via a [paymaster](/smart-wallet/how-it-works#paymaster).
- Assign roles and permissions such as signers and admins.
- Upgrade functionality over time when using the dynamic and managed factories.

And more!

Smart Wallets can be deployed via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore) or customized to each application's needs using the [Solidity SDK](/solidity).

The `SmartWallet` API is **composable** - you can use with your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract and you can also use your own bundler or paymaster services.
