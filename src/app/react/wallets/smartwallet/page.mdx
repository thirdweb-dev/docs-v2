# smartWallet

A wallet configurator for [Smart Wallet](/wallets/smart-wallet) which allows integrating the wallet with React

```tsx
import { smartWallet, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const walletConfig = metamaskWallet(); // or use any other wallet

const smartWalletConfig = smartWallet(walletConfig, {
	factoryAddress: "0x...",
	gasless: true,
});
```

## options

<Details summary="walletConfig">

Provide a `WalletConfig` object to use as the personal wallet for the Smart Wallet. You can get this object by calling a wallet configurator function such as `metamaskWallet()`

You can see the list of available wallet configurators for React [here](http://localhost:3000/react/connecting-wallets).

</Details>

<Details summary="factoryAddress">

The address of the Smart Wallet Factory contract.

Must be a `string`.

</Details>

<Details summary="gasless">

Whether to turn on or off gasless transactions.

- If set to `true`, all gas fees will be paid by a paymaster.
- If set to `false`, all gas fees will be paid by the Smart Wallet itself (needs to be funded).

Must be a `boolean`.

</Details>

## Usage with ConnectWallet

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react/react.connectwallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#supportedwallets-optional) prop.

```tsx
import {
  smartWallet,
  metamaskWallet,
  coinbaseWallet,
  walletConnect,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const config = {
  factoryAddress: "0x...",
  gasless: true,
}

<ThirdwebProvider
  supportedWallets={[
    smartWallet(metamaskWallet(), config),
    smartWallet(coinbaseWallet(), config),
    smartWallet(walletConnect(), config),
  ]}
  clientId="your-client-id"
>
  <YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

## Usage with `useSmartWallet`

you can use the [`useSmartWallet`](/references/react/useSmartWallet) hook to programmatically connect to the smart wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/references/react/ConnectWallet) component.

`smartWallet()` also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

```tsx
import { useSmartWallet, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function Example() {
	// here we're using metamask as the personal wallet
	// can be any other wallet, including localWallet(), embeddedWallet(), etc
	const { connect } = useSmartWallet(metamaskWallet(), {
		factoryAddress: "your-factory-address",
		gasless: true,
	});

	return (
		<button
			onClick={async () => {
				const smartWallet = await connect();
				console.log(
					"connected to smart wallet",
					await smartWallet.getAddress(),
				);
			}}
		>
			Connect
		</button>
	);
}
```
