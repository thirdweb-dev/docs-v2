[Migrate from React v4](/react/v5/migrate)

# Interacting with contracts

With SDK v4, you always have to "load" a contract with `useContract`. This process adds complexity to your app and inpacts its performance.  
In the latest version, a smart contract (type: [`ThirdwebContract`](/references/typescript/v5/ThirdwebContract)) represents a simple object containing info about the contract address, the chain it was deployed on, and the thirdweb client object.

Example for declaring a smart contract on Ethereum mainnet
```tsx
import { getContract, createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ethereum } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TW_CLIENT_ID,
});

const contract = getContract({
  address: "0x....",
  chain: ethereum,
  client,
});
```

## Contract extensions

This is a new terminology that we introduced in the new SDK. Basically, each extension represents a method of a contract, be it a "write" or a "read" method.

An extension is a function that returns a [`PreparedTransaction`](/references/typescript/v5/PreparedTransaction) which in turn can be executed in a React hook for interacting with the contract. We will talk more about it in the section below.

One of the amazing updates that v5 brings is the rich set of prebuilt extensions. They are the contract methods that have been precompile to ensure a typesafe & performant developer experience.

Check out the list of over 100 prebuilt extensions [here](/typescript/v5/extensions/built-in), ranging from ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 to top popular DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Farcaster & Lens.

Example: Import an ERC1155 "read" extension, for checking the balance of a wallet
```tsx
import { balanceOf } from "thirdweb/extension/erc1155";

const transaction = balanceOf({
  contract,
  owner: "0x...",
  tokenId: 0n,
});
```

## Reading states of a contract
Given the task of calling `balanceOf` from an ERC1155 contract, we'll be comparing the code between v4 and v5

#### SDK v4
```tsx
import { useNFTBalance, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { isLoading, data, error } = useNFTBalance(
    contract,
    "{{wallet_address}}",
    "{{token_id}}",
  );
}

```

#### SDK v5
```tsx
import { getContract, createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { balanceOf } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc1155";
import { ethereum } from "thirdweb/chains";
import { client } from "@lib/client";

const contract = getContract({
  address: "0x....",
  chain: ethereum,
  client,
});

function App() {
  const { data } = useReadContract(balanceOf, { contract, owner: "0x...", tokenId: 0n });
}
```

As you can see from the example above, we introduced the hook [`useReadContract`](/references/typescript/v5/useReadContract) in v5. You should use it to perform any contract "read".
It is the perfect replacement for the old chunky React hooks from v4.
