# InAppWallet.Create

Create an instance of `InAppWallet` using a user's email or phone number. This wallet type facilitates secure user authentication through OTP verification, making it suitable for client-facing applications where handling private keys directly is not ideal.

## Usage

```csharp
var wallet = await InAppWallet.Create(client, "userEmail", "userPhoneNumber");
```

<Callout variant="info" title="Client-Side Use">
	This wallet is designed for client-side use in applications where direct access to the user's private keys is not safe or necessary. It leverages OTP for secure authentication, allowing users to interact with blockchain applications seamlessly.
</Callout>
<Details summary="Parameters">

### client (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebClient`.

### email (optional)

The user's email address. Required if `phoneNumber` is not provided.

### phoneNumber (optional)

The user's phone number. Required if `email` is not provided.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### InAppWallet

Returns an instance of InAppWallet, initialized for the user based on the provided email or phone number. This wallet is ready for OTP authentication and further blockchain interactions.

## OTP Authentication Flow

The OTP authentication flow involves sending an OTP to the user's email or phone and then verifying the OTP to complete authentication:

**Send OTP:** Initiate the login process by calling SendOTP on the InAppWallet instance. This sends an OTP to the user's email or phone number.

```csharp
await wallet.SendOTP();
```

**Submit OTP:** Once the user receives the OTP, they submit it back to the application, which then calls SubmitOTP on the InAppWallet instance to verify the OTP and complete the login process.

```csharp
var (address, canRetry) = await wallet.SubmitOTP("userEnteredOTP");
if (address != null) {
    // Login successful
} else if (canRetry) {
    // Ask user to retry entering OTP
}
```

## Example

Here's an example of creating an `InAppWallet` with a user's email and completing the OTP authentication flow:

```csharp
// Create InAppWallet wallet as signer to unlock web2 auth
var inAppWallet = await InAppWallet.Create(client: client, email: "email@email.com"); // or email: null, phoneNumber: "+1234567890"

// Resume session (if `InAppWallet` wallet was not logged in)
if (!await inAppWallet.IsConnected())
{
    await inAppWallet.SendOTP();
    Console.WriteLine("Please submit the OTP.");
    var otp = Console.ReadLine();
    (var inAppWalletAddress, var canRetry) = await inAppWallet.SubmitOTP(otp);
    if (inAppWalletAddress == null && canRetry)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Please submit the OTP again.");
        otp = Console.ReadLine();
        (inAppWalletAddress, _) = await inAppWallet.SubmitOTP(otp);
    }
    if (inAppWalletAddress == null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("OTP login failed. Please try again.");
        return;
    }
}

Console.WriteLine($"InAppWallet address: {await inAppWallet.GetAddress()}");

// Sign a message
var message = "Hello, Thirdweb!";
var signature = await wallet.PersonalSign(message);
Console.WriteLine($"Signature: {signature}");
```

**Note:** InAppWallet leverages the security of OTP-based authentication to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience in blockchain applications.
