# Enable Gasless Transactions

By combining [Account abstraction](/connect/account-abstraction) and [In-App Wallet](/connect/in-app-wallet/overview), you can create a truly seamless user experience:

- Gasless transactions
- Batched transactions
- Full account recovery the user "account"

Let's create an app that creates smart accounts for our users.

These smart accounts will require a **“personal wallet”** to access and initialize the wallet. For this personal wallet, we will of course use an in-app wallet.

From the user's perspective, they will log in with their email or social account. Under the hood, an in-app wallet is created for them, and then a smart account is created and initialized using the in-app wallet.

When the user connects a wallet by entering their email, they will be able to view & interact with their smart account:

	tag="v4 SDK"

## 1. Deploy an Account Factory

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337).

Select the appropriate thirdweb account factory type for your app:

<ArticleIconCard
	icon={Layers2Icon}
	title="Account Factory"
	href={"https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory"}
/>

<ArticleIconCard
	icon={Layers2Icon}
	title="Managed Account Factory"
	href={"https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"}
/>

</Stack>

## 2. Enable account abstraction in your app

To enable account abstraction in your app, you need to add the `accountAbstraction` prop to the `ConnectButton` or `ConnectEmbed` component.

```jsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallets = [inAppWallet()];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton
				client={client}
				wallets={wallets}
				accountAbstraction={{
					factoryAddress: "0x...", // your factory address
					chain: sepolia, // your chain
					gasless: true,
				}}
			/>
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

This will create an in-app wallet and a smart account for the user. The smart account will be initialized with the in-app wallet as the owner.

Pass your deployed `factoryAddress` to the `accountAbstraction` prop. This will allow the smart account to be be deployed only when the user sends their first transaction.

You can sponsor transactions simply by passing `gasless: true` to the `accountAbstraction` prop. This will allow the smart account to send transactions without the user needing to hold any ETH.
