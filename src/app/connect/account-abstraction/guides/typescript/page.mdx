# Using Account abstraction in Typescript

By using the [wallet SDK](/references/wallets/latest) alongside the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript/latest), you can use smart accounts in your applications easily.

## Example Use Cases

The wallet SDK with the TypeScript SDK is primarily used when creating a backend for your application or when creating a node script.
In this guide, we will be using the wallet SDK to create a Node script but the logic for creating a backend is the same.

If you are working in a React environment, you are recommended to follow [this guide](/connect/account-abstraction/guides/react).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Deploy an Account Factory">

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337).
thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of account factories:

	<ArticleIconCard

		icon={WalletsSmartIcon}
	/>
</Grid>

Read about the differences between the three factory types [here](/connect/account-abstraction/how-it-works).

</Step>
<Step title="Create an API key">

To use the bundler and paymaster, you must create an API key and a billing account.

To create an API Key:

- Head to the settings page in the dashboard and click the **API Keys** tab.
- Click on **Create API Key**:
- Follow the steps to create your API key.

To use account abstraction infrastructure on mainnet you will also need to [create an account and add a payment method](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/billing).

</Step>
<Step title="Create a Node Script">

To use smart accounts in a node script, simply create a new Node.js project and install the `thirdweb` package.

```bash
npm i thirdweb
```

Create a `.env` file and add the following:

```bash
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
PRIVATE_KEY=<A_TEST_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

Create an `index.ts` file where we'll write our script.

</Step>
<Step title="Creating the Personal Wallet Key">

This smart account is unlocked by a 'key' - a personal wallet.
This key can be anything from a MetaMask wallet or an In-App Wallet or just a private key and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the smart account.

To create a personal wallet key, we are going to use the [`privateKeyAccount`](/references/typescript/v5/privateKeyAccount), which we need to import from the `thirdweb/wallets` package.

```typescript
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { privateKeyAccount } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
	secretKey: process.env.THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY as string,
});

const personalAccount = privateKeyAccount({
	client,
	privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
});
console.log("Personal account address:", personalAccount.address);
```

</Step>
<Step title="Creating the Smart account">

Now, let's create a smart account using the SmartWallet class from the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package.
To do this, we need to pass a `SmartWalletConfig` object to the constructor. This object contains the following properties:

- `chain`: the chain that the smart account will be deployed on.
- `factoryAddress`: the address of the account factory contract.
- `gasless`: whether the smart account should have sponsored transactions or not.

Once we have created the config and instantiated the `SmartWallet` class, we can connect the personal wallet to the smart account using the `connect` method.

```typescript
// Configure the smart wallet
const config = {
	chain: sepolia,
	factoryAddress: "0x...", // your factory address
	gasless: true,
};

// Connect the smart wallet
const wallet = smartWallet(config);
const smartAccount = await wallet.connect({
	client,
	personalAccount,
});
```

</Step>
<Step title="Using the Smart Account">

Now that we have created a smart account object and connected it, we can use it to perform onchain actions gaslessly.

In this example, we will claim a NFT using the `claimTo` method and then send the transaction using the `sendTransaction` method.

```typescript
const balance = await getWalletBalance({
	client,
	chain,
	address: smartAccount.address,
});
console.log("Smart account balance:", balance.displayValue);

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain: sepolia,
	address: "0x...", // deploy a drop contract from thirdweb.com/explore
});

const transaction = await claimTo({
	contract,
	to: smartAccount.address,
	quantity: 1,
});
const { transactionHash } = await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	smartAccount,
});
console.log(`Minted NFT with transaction hash: ${transactionHash}`);
```

We have also passed our `secretKey` to the SDK so that we can use the bundler and paymaster.

We have also added some helpful logs to view the smart account address and balance using the associated `balance` and `getAddress` methods.

</Step>
<Step title="Run the Script">

To run the script, run the following command:

```bash
bun index.ts
```

As you can see in the terminal output, upon claiming the token, the smart account is deployed. This is because smart account contracts are deployed when the first transaction is initiated.

We have successfully deployed a smart account using our factory contract and claimed an ERC20 token!

</Step>
<Step title="Conclusion">

In this guide, we have learned how to use the wallet SDK with the TypeScript SDK to
create a smart account and claim an NFT.
