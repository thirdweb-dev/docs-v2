# Using Account Abstraction in React

By using the [wallet SDK](/references/wallets/latest) alongside the [React SDK](/react/latest), you can use smart accounts in your front-end applications easily.

<Steps>

<Step title="Deploy an Account Factory">

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/overview).

thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of account factories:

<Grid>
	<ArticleIconCard

		icon={WalletsSmartIcon}
	/>
	<ArticleIconCard
		title="Managed Account Factory"
		href="https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"
		icon={WalletsSmartIcon}
	/>
</Grid>

Read about the differences between the three smart account types [here](/account-abstraction/how-it-works).

</Step>
<Step title="Create an API key">

To use the bundler and paymaster, you must create an API key and a billing account.

To create an API Key:

- Head to the settings page in the dashboard and click the **API Keys** tab.
- Click on **Create API Key**:
- Follow the steps to create your API key.

To use account abstraction nfrastructure on mainnet you will also need to [create an account and add a payment method](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/billing).

</Step>

<Step title="Create an App">

To use smart accounts in a React app you can either:

- Use [npx thirdweb create](/cli/create) command to create a new project with the dependencies already installed.
- Add the dependencies to an existing project using `npx thirdweb install` or your favorite package manager.

In this guide, we'll create a new project. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create app
```

When prompted, select/input the following options:

- A name for the project
- `EVM` as the blockchain
- Select your desired environment e.g. `Next.js` or `Vite`.
- `TypeScript` as the language.

This will create a react project with all the dependencies and a simple connect wallet button.

</Step>
<Step title="Build your connection UI">

#### Using Connect Wallet (prebuilt UI)

To use the [Connect Wallet](/references/react/v4/ConnectWallet) component to connect your users to your app using smart accounts,
we need to pass a [`smartWallet`](/references/react/v4/smartWallet) to the `supportedWallets` prop in [`ThirdwebProvider`](/references/react/v4/ThirdwebProvider).

You can change the configuration based on your requirements,
but for this demo, we will enable **gasless transactions** and use a [EmbeddedWallet](/references/react/v4/embeddedWallet) as the personal wallet.

```tsx
import { smartWallet, embeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const personalWallet = embeddedWallet(); // or any other wallet

export const smartWalletConfig = smartWallet(personalWallet, {
	factoryAddress: "your-factory-address",
	gasless: true,
});
```

Pass the configuration to the provider:

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
	clientId="<your-client-id>"
	activeChain={activeChain}
	supportedWallets={[smartWalletConfig]}
>
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

Now, import the `ConnectWallet` component from the React package and add it to your app:

```tsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb/react";

function App() {
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<ConnectWallet />
		</div>
	);
}
```

Clicking on the connect button will show the following Modal which allows you to create or import a local wallet.

This is the personal wallet you are using to initialize the smart account. For local wallet, you can create a new wallet with a password or import a previously created wallet.

After connecting your personal wallet, a smart account is created for you and connected to the application.

#### Using the `useSmartWallet` hook (custom UI)

The [useSmartWallet](/references/react/v4/useSmartWallet) hook allows you to programmatically connect your application to the wallet. You will need to build your own UI for connecting the wallet.

```tsx
import { useSmartWallet, metamaskWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function Example() {
	// here we're using metamask as the personal wallet
	// can be any other wallet, including localWallet(), embeddedWallet(), etc
	const { connect } = useSmartWallet(metamaskWallet(), {
		factoryAddress: "your-factory-address",
		gasless: true,
	});

	return (
		<button
			onClick={async () => {
				const smartWallet = await connect();
				console.log(
					"connected to smart wallet",
					await smartWallet.getAddress(),
				);
			}}
		>
			Connect
		</button>
	);
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Use the Smart account">

Now that you have connected your smart account to your app, you can use it to send transactions and interact with smart contracts.

Deploy a NFT Drop contract from the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/nft-drop) or build your own [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) compatible contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/overview).

Use the dashboard to upload some NFTs that we will claim with our smart account.

To claim an NFT, we will use the [useContract](/references/react/v4/useContract) hook to fetch the contract and the [Web3Button](/react/v4/components/Web3Button) component to send the transaction.

```tsx
import { useAddress, useContract, useOwnedNFTs, Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// The ThirdwebProvider setup above already handles connection to the smart wallet
// Within the provider, you can use the react SDK hooks to interact with the blockchain
export default function MyComponent() {
  // Get the connected smart wallet address
  const smartWalletAddress = useAddress();
  // Fetch owned NFTs
  const { contract } = useContract("0x..."); // your nft drop contract
  const { data, isLoading } = useOwnedNFTs(contract, smartWalletAddress);
  // Mint a new NFT
  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={"0x..."}
      action={(contract) => contract.erc721.claim(1)
      }
    >
      Mint NFT
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
`;
```

</Step>
<Step title="Bonus: Add a Session Key">

To add a session key to your smart wallet, you can use the [`useCreateSessionKey`](/references/react/v4/useCreateSessionKey) hook to add a session key to the currently connected smart wallet:

```tsx
import { useCreateSessionKey } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const keyAddress = "{{key_address}}";

const Component = () => {
    const {
      mutate: createSessionKey,
      isLoading,
      error,
    } = useCreateSessionKey();

    const handleOnClick = () => {
	    createSessionKey(
          keyAddress, // the session key address
          {
            approvedCallTargets: ["0x..."], // the addresses of allowed contracts, or '*' for any contract
            nativeTokenLimitPerTransaction: 0.1, // Optional: the maximum amount of native token (in ETH) that the session key can spend per transaction
            startDate: new Date(), // Optional: the date when the session key becomes active
            expirationDate = new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Optional: the date when the session key expires
          }
        );
    };

    return (
      <button
        disabled={isLoading}
        onClick={() => handleOnClick()}
      >
        Create Session Key
      </button>
    );
};
```

</Step>

<Step title="Conclusion">

In this guide, we learned how to connect users to a React app using two methods:

- With the Connect Wallet component.
- With a custom UI component via the `useConnect` hook.
- Low-level control with `ThirdwebSDKProvider` and the Wallet SDK.
