# Bundler & Paymaster Infrastructure

The thirdweb SDK handles all the heavy lifting of bundling operations and covering gas fees with a turn key infrastructure.
The thirdweb paymaster and bundler services are **stand alone** and can be used with any smart account contract without using the thirdweb SDKs.

On testnets, the only requirement is to obtain a free client id to get started.
Once you're ready to deploy on mainnets, you will require an active [billing account](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings).
You can configure your client id to restrict interactions only with your own contracts or with any contract.

### Supported chains

## Using a Custom Bundler & Paymaster

Smart accounts are free to use with your own account abstraction infrastructure. To use your own paymaster & bundler,
pass the `bundlerUrl`, `paymasterUrl` the `SmartWalletConfig` object:

```javascript
const config: SmartWalletConfig = {
  chain,
  gasless,
  factoryAddress,
  clientId,
  bundlerUrl: "your-bundler-url",
  paymasterUrl: "your-paymaster-url",
};
```

You can also provide an entirely custom paymaster logic by extending the `PaymasterAPI` class and passing it to the `paymasterAPI` field.

```javascript
class MyPaymaster extends PaymasterAPI {
  async getPaymasterAndData(
    userOp: Partial<UserOperationStruct>,
  ): Promise<string> {
    // your implementation, must return the signed paymaster data
  }
}

const config: SmartWalletConfig = {
  chain,
  gasless,
  factoryAddress,
  clientId,
  bundlerUrl: "your-bundler-url",
  paymasterAPI: new MyPaymaster(),
};
```

## Pricing & Billing

To use thirdweb's account abstraction infrastructure, you need to setup a billing account on the thirdweb dashboard Settings page.

**Pricing**:

- **Bundler**: Transaction bundle calls (non-sponsored calls) are free to use.
- **Paymaster**: 10% premium on top of network fee based on your usage.

Find more information on the different billing tiers by visiting [thirdweb's pricing page](https://thirdweb.com/pricing).
