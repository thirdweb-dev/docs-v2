# Account Abstraction

Everything you need to leverage account abstraction technology to enable seamless user experiences for your users. You get all the tools to integrate account abstraction into your app. This includes:

- Account factory contracts that let you spin up smart accounts for your users
- Bundler, which is the infrastructure needed to process account abstraction transactions (known as User Ops)
- Paymaster, which lets you sponsor transaction fees for your users

## Features

thirdweb's smart accounts have the following features by default:

- The ability to have multiple owners on the same wallet.
- Give access to scoped session keys with restrictions.
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens to and from the smart account.
- Send and receive [ERC-721](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-721/ERC721) and [ERC-1155](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-1155/ERC1155) NFTs from the smart account.
- Store contract metadata.
- Pay for its own gas via a [paymaster](/connect/account-abstraction/how-it-works#paymaster).
- Assign roles and permissions such as signers and admins.
- Upgrade functionality over time when using the managed factories.

And more!

Account factories (contracts that let you spin up smart accounts for your users) can be deployed via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore) or customized to each application's needs using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/overview). The `SmartWallet` API is **composable** - you can use with your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract and you can also use your own bundler or paymaster services.
