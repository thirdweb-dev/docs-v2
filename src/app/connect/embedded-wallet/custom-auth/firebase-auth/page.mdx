# Integrate Firebase Auth

Learn how to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) from Firebase using Firebase’s email provider and integrate it with Embedded Wallet.

<Callout title="Info" variant="info">

This article covers the steps of integrating Firebase Auth for a React Native app. Firebase steps and the Embedded Wallet code may be replicated for React.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Firebase project
- React Native CLI installed

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a React Native App">
To skip over initialization steps, we will use the React Native TypeScript starter template. You may also integrate this functionality into an existing application by installing the React Native SDK.

1. Create the template from the CLI:

   ```bash
   npx thirdweb create --template react-native-typescript-starter
   ```

   This command will create a React Native app with the `@thirdweb-dev/react-native` SDK already installed.

2. Note that we assume this is a simple app with a single screen `App.tsx`.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up your Firebase project">
	1. Set up a React Native Firebase project by following the [prerequisites in
	the React Native Firebase
	documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#1-install-via-npm). 2. Navigate to the
	[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new
	project. 3. Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method, to enable the
	[Email/Password
	provider](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage#emailpassword-sign-in)
</Step>

<Step title="Set up the custom JSON Web Keys link through dashboard">

1. Navigate to Wallets > [Embedded Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded)
2. To use embedded wallets, choose an existing API key or create a new one. Learn more about API keys.

   <DocImage src={ewCreateKey} />

3. In the configuration view, enable **Custom JSON Web Token.**

   <DocImage src={configurationView} />

4. Set the [JWKS URI from here](https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com)

5. Set the AUD Value as the Firebase projectId. (Example, `custom-auth-53169`)

   <DocImage src={customJsonFirebase} />

6. Select **Save changes**.

</Step>

<Step title="Add the Firebase auth dependencies">
Firebase auth depends on the `firebase/app` and `firebase/auth` packages.

To add the packages, run the following command in the project:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth
```

</Step>

<Step title="Implement Email Authentication">
Add the code snippet below to handle email authentication with Firebase. Note that you need to add UI to allow users to input the email and password fields in your `App.tsx` file:

To handle email authentication with Firebase

```jsx
import auth from "@react-native-firebase/auth";

async function signInWithEmail(email, password) {
	try {
		await auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
}

return (
	<Button title="Sign In" onPress={() => signInWithEmail(email, password)} />
);
```

Note: You may add a UI to allow users to input email and password fields.

</Step>

<Step title="Obtain the JWT">
Once the user is authenticated, you can listen to `AuthStateChanged` [events to get the signed in user](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage#listening-to-authentication-state). You can then get the JWT from the User object:

To receive the signed in user, listen to the `AuthStateChanged` event. You can add this code in your App.tsx file as well:

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState();

function onAuthStateChanged(user) {
	setUser(user);
}

useEffect(() => {
	// Listens to AuthStateChanged events
	const subscriber = auth().onAuthStateChanged(onAuthStateChanged);
	return subscriber;
}, [onAuthStateChanged]);

async function getFirebaseJWT() {
	if (user) {
		return await user.getIdToken();
	} else {
		throw new Error("User is not authenticated");
	}
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Pass the JWT to EmbeddedWallet">
Pass the JWT to the Embedded Wallet config in your `App.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { useEmbeddedWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const connectEmbedded = useEmbeddedWallet();

await connectEmbedded({
	strategy: "jwt",
	jwt: await getFirebaseJWT(),
	encryptionKey: "your-encryption-key",
});
```

You can set your encryptionKey in either a secret env variable or ask the user to enter a password for it.

** Do not hardcode the encryptionKey in your code. **

After the connectEmbedded function returns, the ThirdwebProvider will have connected a wallet thereby granting access to all hooks and functionalities.

</Step>

<Step title="Access the connected wallet">
To access the connected wallet, use the `useWallet()` hook:

```jsx
import { useWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const activeWallet = useWallet();
```

</Step>

</Steps>
