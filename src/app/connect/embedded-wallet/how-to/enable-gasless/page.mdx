# Enable Gasless Transactions

By combining [Account abstraction](/connect/account-abstraction) and [Embedded Wallet](/connect/embedded-wallet/overview), you can create a truly seamless user experience:

- Gasless transactions
- Batched transactions
- Full account recovery the user "account"

Let's create an app that creates smart accounts for our users.

These smart accounts will require a **“personal wallet”** to access and initialize the wallet. For this personal wallet, we will of course use an embedded wallet.

From the user's perspective, they will log in with their email or social account. Under the hood, an embedded wallet is created for them, and then a smart account is created and initialized using the embedded wallet.

When the user connects a wallet by entering their email, they will be able to view & interact with their smart account:

## 1. Deploy an Account Factory

Deployable via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337).

Select the appropriate thirdweb account factory type for your app:

<ArticleIconCard
	icon={Layers2Icon}
	title="Account Factory"
	href={"https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory"}
/>

<ArticleIconCard
	icon={Layers2Icon}
	title="Managed Account Factory"
	href={"https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ManagedAccountFactory"}
/>

</Stack>

## 2. Enable account abstraction in your app

To enable account abstraction in your app, you need to add the `accountAbstraction` prop to the `ConnectButton` or `ConnectEmbed` component.

```jsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { embeddedWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallets = [embeddedWallet()];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton
				client={client}
				wallets={wallets}
				accountAbstraction={{
					factoryAddress: "0x...", // your factory address
					chain: sepolia, // your chain
					gasless: true,
				}}
			/>
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

This will create an embedded wallet and a smart account for the user. The smart account will be initialized with the embedded wallet as the owner.

Pass your deployed `factoryAddress` to the `accountAbstraction` prop. This will allow the smart account to be be deployed only when the user sends their first transaction.

You can sponsor transactions simply by passing `gasless: true` to the `accountAbstraction` prop. This will allow the smart account to send transactions without the user needing to hold any ETH.
