# Quickstart

Learn how to add Connect SDK to your application, log in your users, and allow them to interact with your application.

The following guide is in Typescript. You can also learn how to integrate Connect with our [Unity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).

---

## Install the Connect SDK

```bash
npm i thirdweb
```

## Get Your Client ID

Log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**.

## Set up the Connect SDK

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

export const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: <your_client_id> });

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Interact With A Wallet

Once your user has logged in, interact with the application using different functions such as fetching balances, wallet addresses and sending transactions.

### Read wallet address and balance

```tsx
import { useActiveAccount, useWalletBalance } from "thirdweb/react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  // get wallet address
  const account = useActiveAccount();
  console.log("wallet address", account?.address);
  
  // get balance
  const { data: balance, isLoading } = useWalletBalance({
    client,
    chain,
    address: account?.address,
  });
  console.log("wallet balance", balance?.displayValue, balance?.symbol);
}
```

### Send a Transaction

Once your user has logged in, interact with the application using different functions such as fetching balances and wallet addresses:

```tsx
import { useActiveAccount, useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";
import { transfer } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";

const USDC = getContract({ client, address: USDC_ADDRESS, chain: sepolia });

export default function MyComponent() {
  const account = useActiveAccount();
  const { mutate: sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();

  const onClick = () => {
    // send 15 USDC to the target address
    const transaction = transfer({ contract: USDC, amount: 15, to: "0x..." });
    sendTransaction(transaction);
  }
}
```
