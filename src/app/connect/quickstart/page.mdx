# QuickStart

Learn how to add the Connect to your application, log in your users, and allow them to interact with your application.

The following guide is in Typescript. You can also learn how to integrate Connect with our [Unity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/pay/getbuywithcryptoquote).

---

## Install the Connect SDK

```bash
npm i thirdweb
```

## Get Your Client ID

Log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**.

## Set up the Connect SDK

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton, createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

## Interact With A Wallet

Once your user has logged in, you can start getting information like balances and wallet addresses:

```tsx
import { useActiveAccount } from "thirdweb/react";
 
// get wallet address
const account = useActiveAccount();
console.log("wallet address", account.address);

// get balance
const balance = await getWalletBalance({
  client,
  chain,
  address: account.address,
});
console.log("wallet balaance", balance);
```

## You’re Ready to web3

With Connect instantiated and your user logged in, you can now access all the powerful features your app needs to succeed!
