# Get Started

Learn how to spin up your first ecosystem wallet, brand your wallet, and integrate your first ecosystem partner.

## Get your Client ID

On the thirdweb dashboard, navigate to settings to create an API Key to obtain a Client ID.

## Deploy Your Instance

Visit the [Ecosystem Wallets dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) and enter the name of your ecosystem and choose your logo (optional). Your ecosystem name is immutable and will appear wherever your wallet is available, so choose carefully.

## Set Ecosystem Permissions

There are two permission options depending on whether you’d like an open or exclusive ecosystem wallet.

### Anyone

If you want to allow anyone to integrate your ecosystem wallet, no other changes are required. You can protect your ecosystem against malicious actors by adding unwanted domains to your blocklist.

### Allowlist

If you’re looking to create an ecosystem wallet for select partners, you can head to the Ecosystem Wallet dashboard, navigate to Permissions, and select “Allowlist”.

#### Add Your First Partner

Underneath “Allowlist” you’ll be able to create your first partner application or game by entering their name and a list of allowed domains. This list of domains will determine where a partner will be able to display your ecosystem as a login option.
