# Managing Ecosystem Permissions

There are two permission options depending on whether you’d like an open or exclusive ecosystem wallet. You can manage these permissions from the Permissions page in your Ecosystem Wallet Dashboard.

### Anyone

If you want to allow anyone to integrate your ecosystem wallet, no other changes are required. You can protect your ecosystem against malicious actors by adding unwanted domains to your blocklist.

### Allowlist

If you’re looking to create an ecosystem wallet for select partners, you can head to the Ecosystem Wallet dashboard, navigate to Permissions, and select “Allowlist”.

#### Add Your First Partner

Underneath “Allowlist” you’ll be able to create your first partner application or game by entering their name and a list of allowed domains. This list of domains will determine where a partner will be able to display your ecosystem as a login option.
