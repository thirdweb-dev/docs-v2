# Get Started

Learn how to add Pay to any transaction execution or embed Pay directly into your application.

The following guide uses our Typescript SDK. You can also learn how to integrate Pay with our [Unity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity/pay/getbuywithcryptoquote).

---

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Connect SDK">

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn install thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
/>
</Step>
<Step title="Get Your Client ID">

Log in to [the thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Send a Transaction with Pay

Pay is enabled by default for any contract call sent with `sendTransaction`. It will automatically be invoked when a user does not have enough funds to complete the transaction.

<Callout variant="info">
	ℹ️ `sendTransaction` is available in [Connect SDK v5](/typescript/v5) or
	above.
</Callout>

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, sendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<button onClick={() => sendTransaction()} />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

When a user clicks this button, Pay will perform gas estimation to determine if the user has a sufficient balance. If their balance is sufficient, the transaction will execute normally. If their balance is not sufficient, the following modal will pop up asking them to either onramp funds or convert crypto to the required amount:

<DocImage src={GetStartedSend} />

Once a user onramps or converts their funds to the required token, the user will be prompted once more to confirm the transaction. The transaction will then execute as expected.

---

## Embed Pay

Pay works as its own standalone component that you can place directly into your site via the `PayEmbed` component.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, PayEmbed } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<PayEmbed />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

The embedded Pay component will be displayed like so in your application interface:

<DocImage src={GetStartedEmbed} />

And voila! Your users can now onramp and convert crypto directly from your application.

---

## Customize Pay

You can customize the look of Pay, modify available tokens, and more by following our [customization guide](/connect/pay/customization). To see all configuration options for the Pay modal shown above, you can view this reference.
