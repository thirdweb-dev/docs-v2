# Fee Sharing

thirdweb collects a 1% base fee and 30Â¢ flat fee per end user transaction. We share 30% of our base fee with you.

| Fee Share Breakdown     |       |
| :---------------------- | :---- |
| thirdweb Base Fee Share | 0.07% |
| Dev Base Fee Share      | 0.03% |
| thirdweb Flat Fee       | $0.30 |

For example, if a user purchases $100 worth of Polygon through your application, thirdweb charges a total of $1.30. thirdweb collects $0.70 from our base fee and $0.30 from our flat fee, then sends $0.30 to you.

To participate in fee sharing, all you need to do is set a recipient address in your dashboard. Your recipient address can be configured in your dashboard by navigating to [Connect > Pay](https://www.thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/pay).
