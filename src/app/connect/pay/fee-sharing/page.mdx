# Fee Sharing

thirdweb shares 30% of our fee through Buy With Crypto. To participate in fee sharing, all you need to do is set a recipient address in your dashboard.

For example, if a user purchases $100 worth of Polygon through your application, we collect $1.00 and send $0.30 to your recipient address.

Your recipient address can be configured in your dashboard by navigating to [Connect > Pay](https://www.thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/pay) in the side navigation.
