# Fee Sharing

thirdweb collects a 1% base fee and 30Â¢ per end user transaction. We share 30% of our base fee with you.

For example, if a user purchases $100 worth of Polygon through your application, thirdweb collects $0.70 from our base fee and sends $0.30 to you.

To participate in fee sharing, all you need to do is set a recipient address in your dashboard. Your recipient address can be configured in your dashboard by navigating to [Connect > Pay](https://www.thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/pay).
