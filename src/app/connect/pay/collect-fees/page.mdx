# Collect Fees

Any developer can configure a recipient address and introduce their own fees for Buy With Crypto transactions. Configured fees will be charged to users on top of thirdwebâ€™s processing fees.

Your Recipient Address and Buy With Crypto Fee can both be configured in [your dashboard](https://www.thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/pay) by navigating to Connect and selecting Pay in the side navigation.
