# Customization

Learn how to customize the Pay interface. You can find a selection of popular customizations below. For the full list of props, you can [view the full reference](/references/typescript/v5/SendTransactionConfig).

---

## Support Custom Tokens

You can enable users to select your token on a given chain by passing an array of `SupportedTokens`. Note that this array overrides the default tokens displayed for that chain.

```tsx
<PayEmbed
	client={client}
	payOptions={{
		supportedTokens: {
			"1": [
				{
					address: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
					name: "USD Coin",
					symbol: "USDC",
					icon: usdcIcon,
				},
			],
		},
	}}
/>
```

---

## Prefill Custom Token

In the case you want your users to purchase your token by default in your application, you can choose to pre-fill the Pay purchase flow with `prefillBuy` .

For example, if you wanted users to only purchase Ethereum on Base network, you could do as follows:

```tsx
<PayEmbed
	client={client}
	payOptions={{
		prefillBuy: {
			token: {
				address: "0x866a087038f7C12cf33EF91aC5b1AcE6Ac1DA788",
				name: "Base ETH",
				symbol: "ETH",
				icon: "...", // optional
			},
			allowEdits: {
				amount: true, // allow editing buy amount
				token: false, // disable selecting buy token
				chain: false, // disable selecting buy chain
			},
		},
	}}
/>
```

---

## Disable Buy With Crypto

In some cases, you may only want to show users fiat payment options for your onchain goods or services. You can do this by setting buyWithCrypto to false in your payOptions object.

```tsx
<PayEmbed
	client={client}
	payOptions={{
		buyWithCrypto: false, // disable buy with crypto
	}}
/>
```

---

## Theme

You can set the theme for the Pay component, which is set to `"dark"` by default. theme can be set to either `"dark"` , `"light"` or a custom theme object.

We have [`lightTheme`](/references/typescript/v5/lightTheme) or [`darkTheme`](/references/typescript/v5/darkTheme) providers that you can override to kickstart customization.

You can refer to our [`Theme`](/references/typescript/v5/Theme) page for a full view of customizable options if you’d prefer to create a custom theme from scratch.

```tsx
<PayEmbed
	client={client}
	payOptions={{
		theme: yourThemeConfig,
	}}
/>
```

---

## Localization

By default, our ConnectButton uses the `en-US` locale. You can customize the language by setting the `locale` prop.

```tsx
<PayEmbed
	client={client}
	payOptions={{
		locale: "en_US",
	}}
/>
```

thirdweb currently supports the following locales:

| Locale   | localeId  |
| :------- | :-------- |
| English  | `"en_US"` |
| Spanish  | `"es_ES"` |
| Japanese | `"ja_JP"` |
| Filipino | `"tl_PH"` |
