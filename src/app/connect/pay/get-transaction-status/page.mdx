# Get Transaction Status

Once a transaction has been initiated, you’ll want to communicate with your users and inform them when a transaction is still pending, has completed, or has failed. You can achieve all of this with the `useBuyWithCryptoStatus` hook. You’ll need the following parameters to retrieve a swap’s status:

- **transactionId:** The transaction id of the initiated transaction.
- **transactionHash**: The transaction hash of the initiated transaction.

```ts
import { useBuyWithCryptoStatus } from "thirdweb/react";

function Component(buyWithCryptoTx) {
	const buyWithCryptoStatusQuery = useBuyWithCryptoStatus(buyWithCryptoTx);
}
```
