# Overview

Auth is a developer SDK that lets you integrate passwordless web3-native authentication and authorization into your applications.

It enables users to sign in with their wallets, allowing apps to access rich blockchain-level data and interact with their users onchain.

With Auth, developers can build applications that have secure, self-custodied, web3-first authentication.

## Applications

Auth unlocks a variety of new possibilities by enabling the connection of web2 and web3 flows. Add wallet-based authentication to existing applications or build web3 experiences that utilize server-side architecture.

Below are some of the applications that Auth enables:

- **Passwordless Authentication:** Let users seamlessly login to your applications with just their wallets.
- **Identity Verification:** Securely verify the onchain identities of existing users.
- **Gated Resources:** Gate access to protected resources based on onchain criteria like NFT ownership.
- **Onchain Interaction:** Interact with users onchain, like sending users reward NFTs.
- **Onchain Payments:** Allow users to pay for your services with onchain assets like ETH or ERC20 tokens.
- **Access Onchain Data:** Access rich onchain data associated with your users.

## Frameworks

Auth integrates with a variety of server-side and client-side development frameworks. We&apos;re always adding support for more frameworks, so if you don&apos;t see yours, [let us know](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us), and we can explore adding support!
