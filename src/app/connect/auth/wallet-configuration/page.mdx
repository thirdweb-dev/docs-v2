# Wallet Configuration

Auth makes use of a server-side wallet to sign and verify JWTs, as covered in the [how auth works section](/connect/auth/how-it-works/jwt). You can configure this wallet using a variety of wallet management options, giving you the freedom to choose the most convenient and secure setup for your project.

## Simple Wallets

The easiest way to get started with Auth would be to use a simple private key or signer wallet directly. It's easy to use such a setup with just the core `@thirdweb-dev/auth` package.

### Setup

Use the following installation to get started with Auth using a simple EVM private key or signer wallet:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth ethers@5
```

**Private Key Wallet**

You can use an EVM private key (a 64-character hex-string) as your wallet by using the `PrivateKeyWallet` class from the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm` entrypoint.

<Callout variant='warning'>

Never hardcode your private key into your codebase or commit it to version control! Instead, use an environment variable or other secure method to pass your private key in indirectly.

</Callout>

```typescript
import { PrivateKeyWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm";

// Pass private key from environment variables directly
const wallet = new PrivateKeyWallet(
	process.env.THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
);

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

**Signer Wallet**

You can also use any signer wallet compatible with the `ethers.Signer` interface, such as the `ethers.Wallet` class.

```typescript
import { SignerWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Create a new ethers signer or use an existing one
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(...);
const wallet = new SignerWallet(signer);

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

## Advanced Wallets

For more advanced wallet setups like cloud wallets, managed private keys, and more, we have a variety of options available in our `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package. The package is an optional `peerDependency` of `@thirdweb-dev/auth`, so you'll need to install it separately, along with any peer dependencies of the specific wallet you want to use.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/auth @thirdweb-dev/wallets
```

For more information on the available wallets and the specific of their setup, see the [`@thirdweb-dev/wallets` documentation](/references/wallets/latest)

For example, here's how you would use a signing key from AWS Secrets Manager as your Auth wallet using the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package (you would need to install its `@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager` peer dependency as well):

```typescript
import { AwsSecretsManagerWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets/evm/wallets/aws-secrets-manager";

// Pass in your AWS configuration
const wallet = new AwsSecretsManagerWallet({
	secretName: "my-secret",
	secretKeyName: "private-key",
	awsConfig: {
		region: "us-east-1",
		credentials: {
			accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || "",
			secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || "",
		},
	},
});

// Pass the wallet to your auth configuration...
```

## Custom Wallets

If none of the above methods are suitable for your project, you can also create your own custom wallet class by implementing the `GenericAuthWallet` interface from the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets` package for a completely custom setup.

Auth only requires the following simple wallet interface to facilitate the signing and verification of JWTs:

```typescript
interface GenericAuthWallet {
	// Get the address of your wallet
	getAddress(): Promise<string>;
	// Optionally get the chain ID of your wallet (important for EIP1271 wallets)
	getChainId?(): Promise<number>;
	// Sign a message with your wallet
	signMessage(message: string): Promise<string>;
	// Verify a signature
	verifySignature(
		message: string,
		signature: string,
		address: string,
	): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

You can see how this interface is chain agnostic and can be used across different blockchain ecosystems.

For example, here is a minimal implementation of the basic `SignerWallet` class from the `@thirdweb-dev/auth/evm` entry point, which follows the `GenericAuthWallet` interface:

```typescript
import type { Ecosystem, GenericAuthWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

class SignerWallet implements GenericAuthWallet {
	type: Ecosystem = "evm";
	#signer: ethers.Signer;

	constructor(signer: ethers.Signer) {
		this.#signer = signer;
	}

	public async getAddress(): Promise<string> {
		return this.#signer.getAddress();
	}

	public async signMessage(message: string): Promise<string> {
		return await this.#signer.signMessage(message);
	}

	public async verifySignature(
		message: string,
		signature: string,
		address: string,
	): Promise<boolean> {
		const messageHash = ethers.utils.hashMessage(message);
		const messageHashBytes = ethers.utils.arrayify(messageHash);
		const recoveredAddress = ethers.utils.recoverAddress(
			messageHashBytes,
			signature,
		);
		return recoveredAddress === address;
	}
}
```
