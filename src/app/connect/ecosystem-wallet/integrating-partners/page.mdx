# Integrating with Partners

One of the key features of ecosystem wallets is the ability to enable other developers to spin up in-app wallets on your behalf. All partners that spin up in-app wallets using your ecosystem wallet will access the same account for your end users. You can create partners in the Ecosystem Wallets dashboard.

Adding a new partner will create their unique Partner ID. They can use this Partner ID to integrate your wallet in a number of different ways:

### thirdweb SDK

Partners can install thirdweb SDK and use the Partner ID you created for them to display your branded sign in flow. All login options in this sign in flow will create an in-app wallet that works across the ecosystem.

#### Sign In UI

The Sign In UI provides a complete flow with email, phone, passkey, and social sign in options. All options will create an in-app wallet.

```ts
import { ecosystemWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

// Create a wallet for a non-gated ecosystem
const wallet = ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id");

// Create a wallet for ecosystems restricted to partners
const restrictedWallet = ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id", {
	partnerId: "...",
});
```

In the React SDK, provide the wallet as the only option to restrict user logins to the ecosystem.

```ts
<ConnectButton
	client={THIRDWEB_CLIENT}
	wallets={[wallet]} // Pass a non-gated or restricted wallet to the ConnectButton
	{...props}
/>
```

#### Branded Wallet Connector

Partners that want to utilize your Ecosystem Wallet as an option to their existing sign in flow can integrate your wallet separately. In this case, only sign ins through your `ecosystem.your-id` will create in-app wallets within your ecosystem:

```ts
<ConnectButton
	client={THIRDWEB_CLIENT}
	wallets={[
		inAppWallet(),
		createWallet("io.metamask"),
		createWallet("ecosystem.your-id", {
			partnerId: "...", // Pass an optional partner ID for restricted ecosystems
		})
	]}
	{...props}
/>
```

### WalletConnect

If you'd like your wallet to show up as a WalletConnect option, you can follow [this guide](https://blog.thirdweb.com/p/24541a92-7f85-47c0-9f6c-93d93f0dcb60/). Once you complete this guide, your partners will have the option allow sign in with your ecosystem wallet through WalletConnect.
