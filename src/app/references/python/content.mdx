# Python SDK Reference

Best in class Web3 SDK for Python 3.7+

Connect to user's wallets, interact with smart contracts, sign
messages, and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs,
marketplaces; all with built-in RPC URLs, IPFS gateways, and more.

<br />
## Installation

```bash
pip install thirdweb
```

<br />
## Getting Started

To start using this SDK, you just need to pass in a provider
configuration. It is also strongly recommended that you use your thirdweb
API keys with the SDK in order to get the best infrastructure performance
(across RPCs, IPFS, etc.) - you can learn more about creating and using
API keys [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/api-keys).

<br />
### Instantiating the SDK

Once you have all the necessary dependencies, you can follow the following setup steps to get started with the SDK read-only functions:

```python
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK
from thirdweb.types import SDKOptions

# Get your secret key from the thirdweb api keys dashboard
SECRET_KEY = "..."

# You can create a new instance of the SDK to use by passing in a network name and your api key
sdk = ThirdwebSDK("mumbai", options=SDKOptions(secret_key=SECRET_KEY))
```

The SDK supports the `mainnet`, `rinkeby`, `goerli`, `polygon`, `mumbai`, `fantom`, and `avalanche` networks.

Alternatively, if you want to use your own custom RPC URL, you can pass in the RPC URL directly as follows:

```python
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK

# Set your RPC_URL
RPC_URL = "https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network"

# And now you can instantiate the SDK with it
sdk = ThirdwebSDK(RPC_URL)
```

<br />
### Working With Contracts

Once you instantiate the SDK, you can use it to access your thirdweb contracts. You can use the SDK's contract getter functions like `get_token`, `get_edition`, `get_nft_collection`, and `get_marketplace` to get the respective SDK contract instances. To use an NFT Collection contract for example, you can do the following.

```python
# Add your NFT Collection contract address here
NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = "0x.."

# And you can instantiate your contract with just one line
nft_collection = sdk.get_nft_collection(NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS)

# Now you can use any of the read-only SDK contract functions
nfts = nft_collection.get_all()
print(nfts)
```

<br />
### Signing Transactions

<Callout variant="danger">
	Never commit private keys to file tracking history, or your account could be
	compromised.
</Callout>

Meanwhile, if you want to use write functions as well and connect a signer, you can use the following setup:

```python
from thirdweb import ThirdwebSDK
from thirdweb.types.nft import NFTMetadataInput
import os

# Get your secret key from the thirdweb api keys dashboard
SECRET_KEY = "..."

# This PRIVATE KEY is coming from your environment variables. Make sure to never put it in a tracked file or share it with anyone.
PRIVATE_KEY = os.environ.get("PRIVATE_KEY")

# Now you can create a new instance of the SDK with your private key
sdk = ThirdwebSDK.from_private_key(PRIVATE_KEY, "mumbai", options=SDKOptions(secret_key=SECRET_KEY))

# Instantiate a new NFT Collection contract as described above.
NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = "0x.."
nft_collection = sdk.get_nft_collection(NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS)

# Now you can use any of the SDK contract functions including write functions
nft_collection.mint(NFTMetadataInput.from_json({ "name": "Cool NFT", "description": "Minted with the Python SDK!" }))
```
