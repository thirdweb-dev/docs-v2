# Gasless Transactions

Attract a broader audience by removing the need to have gas to use your application. Engine offers multiple options for developers looking to sponsor gas for their users' transactions.

## Use cases

- Build an NFT checkout where the buyer is sent an NFT upon fiat payment.
- Enable users to transfer an NFT to a friend or list an NFT on a marketplace.
- Minimize friction by seamlessly managing transactions for players in a web3 game.

## Approaches

Here are several ways to offer gasless transactions to your users.

### Send transactions with backend wallets

If a transaction does not require the user to send it, a simple solution is sending the transaction from a backend wallet.

Example:

- A user purchases an NFT with fiat from your checkout or marketplace. Your application accepts the payment and calls Engine to claim the NFT to the buyer's wallet.

### Send transactions with smart wallets
