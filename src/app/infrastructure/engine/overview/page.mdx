# Engine

Engine is a backend HTTP server that calls smart contracts using your managed backend wallets.

- <strong>Create & manage funded backend wallets</strong> to send blockchain transactions
  via authenticated APIs.
- <strong>Build scalable blockchain apps</strong> with transaction retries, wallet
  nonce management, and gas estimation.
- <strong>Offer the best UX</strong> by deploying & transacting with user smart wallets,
  enabling sign-less flows and gasless transactions.
- <strong>Get a complete web3 infrastructure</strong> already set up with RPC, IPFS,
  and account abstraction infrastructure.

Engine is fully [open-sourced](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine) and [self-hosted](/infrastructure/engine/get-started). We're improving it daily and welcome your feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/thirdweb)!

  events to automate sending emails, printing shipping labels, or charging customers.

## Why use Engine?

Engine is beneficial if your app:

- Handles multiple company app wallets.
- Requires controlled access by multiple team members.
- Requires transactions to be delivered reliably during traffic bursts and network congestion.
- Sends more than one transaction per block (example: 2 Ethereum transactions within 12 seconds).
- Sponsors gas fees for your users.
- Deploys smart accounts for each user.
- Triggers other actions when wallet or contract events occur.
