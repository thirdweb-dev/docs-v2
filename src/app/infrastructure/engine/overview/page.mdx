# Engine

Engine is a backend HTTP server that calls smart contracts using your managed backend wallets.

- <strong>Create & manage funded backend wallets</strong> to send blockchain transactions
  via authenticated APIs.
- <strong>Build scalable blockchain apps</strong> with transaction retries, wallet
  nonce management, and gas estimation.
- <strong>Offer the best UX</strong> by deploying & transacting with user smart wallets,
  enabling sign-less flows and gasless transactions.
- <strong>Get a complete web3 infrastructure</strong> already set up with RPC, IPFS,
  and account abstraction infrastructure.

## Features

  or with AWS KMS / Google KMS.
- <strong>Any contract on any EVM chain</strong> - Engine supports contract calls
  on all <a href="https://thirdweb.com/chainlist">1000+ EVM blockchains</a> and private
  subnets.
- <strong>High transaction throughput</strong> - Blockchain transactions are processed
  in parallel with nonce management, and stuck transactions are automatically retried.

  	published smart contract
  </a> including tokens, NFTs, marketplaces, and smart accounts.
- <strong>Account abstraction & smart wallets</strong> - Deploy and manage smart
  wallets, use session keys for access controls, and transact on behalf of your users.
- <strong>Gasless transactions</strong> - Sponsor user transactions with gasless
  relayers and user operations.
- <strong>Wallet and contract webhooks</strong> - Get notified of wallet and contract
  events to automate sending emails, printing shipping labels, or charging customers.

  event logs for each transaction, a ledger of backend wallet funds, and more.

## Why use Engine?

Engine is beneficial if your app:

- Handles multiple company app wallets.
- Requires controlled access by multiple team members.
- Requires transactions to be delivered reliably during traffic bursts and network congestion.
- Sends more than one transaction per block (example: 2 Ethereum transactions within 12 seconds).
- Sponsors gas fees for your users.
- Deploys smart accounts for each user.
- Triggers other actions when wallet or contract events occur.
