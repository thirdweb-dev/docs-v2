# Generate

Detects all contract addresses in your project, then fetches and stores each smart contract&rsquo;s ABI in memory (inside `node_modules`);
improving the performance of the SDK when using functions such as [`getContract`](/typescript/v4/interact#contract-instance) and
[`useContract`](/references/react/v4/useContract).

Once the ABIs are cached locally, the SDK becomes **strongly typed** when interacting with your smart contracts.
Providing you with Intellisense and type-checking when using functions such as
[`contract.call`](/typescript/v4/interact), in the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript/latest),
or [`useContractRead`](/references/react/v4/useContractRead), and [`useContractWrite`](/references/react/v4/useContractWrite)
in the [React SDK](/react/latest).

```bash
npx thirdweb generate
```

## Configuration

After the first generation, a `thirdweb.json` file is created at the root of your project containing configuration for the command:

```json
// An example thirdweb.json file
{
	"chainIds": [80001],
	"contracts": [
		{
			"address": "0x5523B2CB564579aAf2947B8d08e2187ff35aE4b2",
			"chainId": 80001
		}
	]
}
```

To add additional contracts to the generation process, add a new object into the `contracts` array in the `thirdweb.json` file:

```json
{
	"chainIds": [80001],
	"contracts": [
		{
			"address": "0x5523B2CB564579aAf2947B8d08e2187ff35aE4b2",
			"chainId": 80001
		},
		{
			"address": "some-other-contract-address",
			"chainId": 80001
		}
	]
}
```

### postinstall Script

A [`postinstall`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#pre--post-scripts) script is also created that performs the `generate` command
after your dependencies are installed; enabling the same ABI caching process and performance improvements in your deployment environments.

You can view and customize the script inside of your `package.json`.

## Usage

The command recursively checks all files in your project for valid smart contract addresses and fetches the ABIs for each contract.
The ABIs are then stored locally in the projects `node_modules/@thirdweb-dev/generated-abis` directory.

Functions that require the fetching of a smart contract such as `getContract` and `useContract` will now use the cached ABIs instead of
fetching them each time the function is called. This improves the performance of your application and allows the SDK to become strongly
typed when interacting with your smart contracts.

```bash
npx thirdweb generate [options]
```

## Options

- `--path <string>` or `-p <string>`: Path to project
- `--key <string>` or `-k <string>`: Optional parameter to use passed in secret key, most useful for continuous integration use cases
